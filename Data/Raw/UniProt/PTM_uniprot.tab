Q9BQE3	reviewed	TUBA1C TUBA6	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.; PTM: Nitration of Tyr-449 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29146869}.; PTM: [Tubulin alpha-1C chain]: Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1 (By similarity). Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-1C chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

In response to TGF-beta, phosphorylated on Ser-465/467 by TGF-beta and activin type 1 receptor kinases. TGF-beta-induced Ser-465/467 phosphorylation declines progressively in a KMT5A-dependent manner. Able to interact with SMURF2 when phosphorylated on Ser-465/467, recruiting other proteins, such as SNON, for degradation. In response to decorin, the naturally occurring inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling, phosphorylated on Ser-240 by CaMK2. Phosphorylated by MAPK3 upon EGF stimulation; which increases transcriptional activity and stability, and is blocked by calmodulin.

Phosphorylated by SRPK1 at multiple serines in its RS domain via a directional (C-terminal to N-terminal) and a dual-track mechanism incorporating both processive phosphorylation (in which the kinase stays attached to the substrate after each round of phosphorylation) and distributive phosphorylation steps (in which the kinase and substrate dissociate after each phosphorylation event). The RS domain of SRSF1 binds to a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain of SRPK1 and this induces certain structural changes in SRPK1 and/or RRM 2 domain of SRSF1, allowing RRM 2 to bind the kinase and initiate phosphorylation. The cycles continue for several phosphorylation steps in a processive manner (steps 1-8) until the last few phosphorylation steps (approximately steps 9-12). During that time, a mechanical stress induces the unfolding of the beta-4 motif in RRM 2, which then docks at the docking groove of SRPK1. This also signals RRM 2 to begin to dissociate, which facilitates SRSF1 dissociation after phosphorylation is completed. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14555757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18155240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18687337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19477182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19886675}.; PTM: Asymmetrically dimethylated at arginines, probably by PRMT1, methylation promotes localization to nuclear speckles. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20308322}.

Q9H4B7	reviewed	TUBB1	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase. This phosphorylation inhibits tubulin incorporation into microtubules. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371510}.

P40763	reviewed	STAT3 APRF	PTM: Tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation with EGF. Tyrosine phosphorylated in response to constitutively activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 (By similarity). Activated through tyrosine phosphorylation by BMX. Tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL6, IL11, LIF, CNTF, KITLG/SCF, CSF1, EGF, PDGF, IFN-alpha, LEP and OSM. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Phosphorylated on serine upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. Serine phosphorylation is important for the formation of stable DNA-binding STAT3 homodimers and maximal transcriptional activity. ARL2BP may participate in keeping the phosphorylated state of STAT3 within the nucleus. Upon LPS challenge, phosphorylated within the nucleus by IRAK1. Upon erythropoietin treatment, phosphorylated on Ser-727 by RPS6KA5. Phosphorylation at Tyr-705 by PTK6 or FER leads to an increase of its transcriptional activity (PubMed:12763138, PubMed:16568091, PubMed:21135090, PubMed:31462771).

In monocytes, the IFN-gamma-induced sequential phosphorylation at Ser-886 and Ser-999 releases EPRS1 from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex, allowing its association with the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation at Ser-999 is specifically required for the RPL13A-mediated interaction of the GAIT complex with eIF4G (PubMed:19647514, PubMed:21220307). Phosphorylation at Ser-999 by RPS6KB1, is also induced by insulin through activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway and promotes the interaction of EPRS1 with SLC27A1 (PubMed:28178239). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19647514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21220307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28178239}.

Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase. This phosphorylation inhibits tubulin incorporation into microtubules. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371510}.

Phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage: phosphorylation at different sites promotes interaction with different set of proteins: phosphorylation at the N-terminus by ATM (residues from 6-178) promotes interaction with PAXIP1 and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of dysfunctional telomeres (PubMed:23727112). Phosphorylation by ATM at residues that are located more C-terminus (residues 300-650) leads to promote interaction with RIF1 (PubMed:23727112, PubMed:23333306, PubMed:28241136). Interaction with RIF1 leads to disrupt interaction with NUDT16L1/TIRR (PubMed:28241136). Phosphorylation at Thr-1609 and Ser-1618 in the UDR motif blocks interaction with H2AK15ub (PubMed:24703952). Dephosphorylated by PPP4C (PubMed:24703952). Hyperphosphorylation during mitosis correlates with its exclusion from chromatin and DNA lesions.

Phosphorylated on Tyr-530 by c-Src kinase (CSK). The phosphorylated form is termed pp60c-src. Dephosphorylated by PTPRJ at Tyr-419. Normally maintained in an inactive conformation with the SH2 domain engaged with Tyr-530, the SH3 domain engaged with the SH2-kinase linker, and Tyr-419 dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 as a result of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) action disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and Tyr-530, Tyr-419 can then become autophosphorylated, resulting in SRC activation. Phosphorylation of Tyr-530 by CSK allows this interaction to reform, resulting in SRC inactivation. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-75 targets SRC to ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. Phosphorylated by PTK2/FAK1; this enhances kinase activity. Phosphorylated by PTK2B/PYK2; this enhances kinase activity.

Q3ZCM7	reviewed	TUBB8	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

P42224	reviewed	STAT1	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues in response to a variety of cytokines/growth hormones including IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, PDGF and EGF. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Upon EGF stimulation, phosphorylation on Tyr-701 (lacking in beta form) by JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2 promotes dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Growth hormone (GH) activates STAT1 signaling only via JAK2. Tyrosine phosphorylated in response to constitutively activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 by several kinases including MAPK14, ERK1/2 and CAMKII on IFN-gamma stimulation, regulates STAT1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 promotes sumoylation though increasing interaction with PIAS. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 by PRKCD induces apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging agents. Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when PTK2/FAK1 is activated; most likely this is catalyzed by a SRC family kinase. Dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues by PTPN2 negatively regulates interferon-mediated signaling. Upon viral infection or IFN induction, phosphorylation on Ser-708 occurs much later than phosphorylation on Tyr-701 and is required for the binding of ISGF3 on the ISREs of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes IKBKE-dependent. Phosphorylation at Tyr-701 and Ser-708 are mutually exclusive, phosphorylation at Ser-708 requires previous dephosphorylation of Tyr-701. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15322115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17561467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17897103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19088846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21135090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22065572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28753426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7543024, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7657660}.; PTM: Sumoylated with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3.

P49767	reviewed	VEGFC	PTM: Undergoes a complex proteolytic maturation which generates a variety of processed secreted forms with increased activity toward VEGFR-3, but only the fully processed form could activate VEGFR-2. VEGF-C first form an antiparallel homodimer linked by disulfide bonds. Before secretion, a cleavage occurs between Arg-227 and Ser-228 producing a heterotetramer. The next extracellular step of the processing removes the N-terminal propeptide. Finally the mature VEGF-C is composed mostly of two VEGF homology domains (VHDs) bound by non-covalent interactions.

Sumoylation occurs at one or more of the three consensus sites, Lys-18, Lys-214 and Lys-230. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21968017}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-221 by CDK1 occurs mainly in G2/M phase (PubMed:21871177). Phosphorylation by PRKCD occurs on a non-ribosomal-associated form which results in translocation of RPS3 to the nucleus and enhances its endonuclease activity (PubMed:19059439). Phosphorylated on Ser-209 by IKKB in response to activation of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex which enhances the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha and mediates the nuclear translocation of RPS3 (PubMed:21399639). Phosphorylation by MAPK is required for translocation to the nucleus following exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents such as hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17560175). Phosphorylation by PKB/AKT mediates RPS3 nuclear translocation, enhances RPS3 endonuclease activity and suppresses RPS3-induced neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:20605787). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19059439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21399639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21871177}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated (PubMed:16314389).

A6NNZ2	reviewed	TUBB8B	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase. This phosphorylation inhibits tubulin incorporation into microtubules. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371510}.

Q9UQF0	reviewed	ERVW-1 ERVWE1	PTM: Specific enzymatic cleavages in vivo yield mature proteins. Envelope glycoproteins are synthesized as an inactive precursor that is heavily N-glycosylated and processed likely by furin in the Golgi to yield the mature SU and TM proteins. The cleavage site between SU and TM requires the minimal sequence [KR]-X-[KR]-R. The intracytoplasmic tail cleavage by the viral protease that is required for the fusiogenic activity of some retroviruses envelope proteins seems to have been lost during evolution. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15827173}.; PTM: The CXXC motif is highly conserved across a broad range of retroviral envelope proteins. It is thought to participate in the formation of a labile disulfide bond possibly with the CX6CC motif present in the transmembrane protein. Isomerization of the intersubunit disulfide bond to an SU intrachain disulfide bond is thought to occur upon receptor recognition in order to allow membrane fusion. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:15827173}.

P68366	reviewed	TUBA4A TUBA1	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.

Phosphorylation by LIMK2, but not LIMK1, regulates astral microtubule organization at early stage of mitosis (PubMed:22328514). Phosphorylation by ROCK1 at Ser-32, Ser-107 and Ser-159 inhibits interaction with HDAC6, resulting in decreased acetylation of tubulin, increased cell motility and entry into S-phase (PubMed:23093407, PubMed:23355470).

Autophosphorylation of the T2609 cluster is required for hematopoietic development and protein synthesis in erythrocytes precursors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97313, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10467406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11889123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12186630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14612514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14627815, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14704337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14734805, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1597196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16046194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16397295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2247066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2507541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8407951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8464713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8804412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9139719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9362500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9363941}.; PTM: S-nitrosylated by GAPDH. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated by RNF144A, leading to proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24979766}.

Phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2 at Ser-60 and Ser-186; phosphorylation increases its stability and cytoplasmic localization, promotes binding to 14-3-3 adapter proteins and inhibits the recruitment of cytoplasmic CCR4-NOT and PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complexes to the mRNA decay machinery, thereby inhibiting ZFP36-induced ARE-containing mRNA deadenylation and decay processes. Phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2 does not impair ARE-containing RNA-binding. Phosphorylated in a MAPKAPK2- and p38 MAPK-dependent manner upon skeletal muscle satellite cell activation; this phosphorylation inhibits ZFP36-mediated mRNA decay activity, and hence stabilizes MYOD1 mRNA (By similarity). Phosphorylated by MAPK1 upon mitogen stimulation (By similarity). Phosphorylated at Ser-66 and Ser-93; these phosphorylations increase in a SH3KBP1-dependent manner (PubMed:20221403). Phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues in a pyruvate kinase PKM- and p38 MAPK-dependent manner (PubMed:26926077).

P2 is cleaved by a furin-like proprotein convertase (PC) in a pH-dependent manner in a post-Golgi, prelysosomal compartment into two disulfide-linked subunits: a large lumenal subunit, M-alpha/ME20-S, and an integral membrane subunit, M-beta. Despite cleavage, only a small fraction of M-alpha is secreted, whereas most M-alpha and M-beta remain associated with each other intracellularly. M-alpha is further processed to M-alpha N and M-alpha C. M-alpha C further undergoes processing to yield M-alpha C1 and M-alpha C3 (M-alpha C2 in the case of PMEL17-is or PMEL17-ls). Formation of intralumenal fibrils in the melanosomes requires the formation of M-alpha that becomes incorporated into the fibrils.

P84022	reviewed	SMAD3 MADH3	PTM: Phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Enhanced phosphorylation in the linker region on Thr-179, Ser-204 and Ser-208 on EGF and TGF-beta treatment. Ser-208 is the main site of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. CDK-mediated phosphorylation occurs in a cell-cycle dependent manner and inhibits both the transcriptional activity and antiproliferative functions of SMAD3. This phosphorylation is inhibited by flavopiridol. Maximum phosphorylation at the G(1)/S junction. Also phosphorylated on serine residues in the C-terminal SXS motif by TGFBR1 and ACVR1. TGFBR1-mediated phosphorylation at these C-terminal sites is required for interaction with SMAD4, nuclear location and transactivational activity, and appears to be a prerequisite for the TGF-beta mediated phosphorylation in the linker region. Dephosphorylated in the C-terminal SXS motif by PPM1A. This dephosphorylation disrupts the interaction with SMAD4, promotes nuclear export and terminates TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Phosphorylation at Ser-418 by CSNK1G2/CK1 promotes ligand-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, thus inhibiting SMAD3-mediated TGF-beta responses. Phosphorylated by PDPK1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11224571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15241418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15588252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16156666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19218245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21947082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8774881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9843571}.; PTM: Acetylation in the nucleus by EP300 in the MH2 domain regulates positively its transcriptional activity and is enhanced by TGF-beta. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16862174}.; PTM: Poly-ADP-ribosylated by PARP1 and PARP2.

P0DPH8	reviewed	TUBA3D	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.; PTM: Nitration of Tyr-450 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29146869}.; PTM: [Tubulin alpha-3D chain]: Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1 (By similarity). Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-3D chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

Phosphorylation also occurs on tyrosine residues after activation of CLEC7A/DECTIN1 by particulate beta-glucan (By similarity). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces phosphorylation of Tyr-69, Tyr-107 and Tyr-131 differentially to allow temporal recruitment of effector proteins GRB2, CSK and BLNK (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Tyr-69 is immediately induced by LPS stimulation and allows GRB2 to bind (By similarity). Tyr-107 is phosphorylated 5 minutes after LPS stimulation, which then allows CSK to bind, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr-131 10 minutes after LPS induction, which allows BLNK to bind (By similarity).

A6NHL2	reviewed	TUBAL3	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group. Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.

Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit.

In metaphase, phosphorylation on Thr-2055 occurs in a kinase CDK1-dependent manner; this phosphorylation maintains low levels of cortical dynein-dynactin complex at metaphase, and hence proper spindle positioning (PubMed:7769006, PubMed:23921553, PubMed:24371089). In anaphase, dephosphorylated on Thr-2055 by phosphatase PPP2CA; this dephosphorylation stimulates its membrane association and with the dynein-dynactin complex its enrichment at the cell cortex, and hence robust spindle elongation (PubMed:23921553, PubMed:24371089). Probably also phosphorylated on Thr-2015 and Ser-2087 by CDK1; these phosphorylations may regulate its cell cortex recruitment during metaphase and anaphase (PubMed:23870127). Phosphorylated on Thr-1047, Ser-1769, Ser-1772, Ser-1789 and Ser-1834 by PLK1; these phosphorylations induce cortical dynein-dynactin complex dissociation from the NUMA1-GPSM2 complex and negatively regulates cortical dynein-dynactin complex localization (PubMed:22327364). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22327364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23870127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23921553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24371089, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7769006}.; PTM: ADP-ribosylated by TNKS at the onset of mitosis; ADP-ribosylation is not required for its localization to spindle poles (PubMed:16076287). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16076287}.; PTM: O-glycosylated during cytokinesis at sites identical or close to phosphorylation sites, this interferes with the phosphorylation status (PubMed:20068230). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20068230}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains.

The remaining part of the ectodomain of mBRI2 containing the BRICHOS domain is cleaved by ADAM10 and is secreted (BRI2C, soluble form). The membrane-bound N-terminal fragment (BRI2C, membrane form) is further proteolytically processed by SPPL2A and SPPL2B through regulated intramembrane proteolysis producing a secreted C-peptide and a BRI2 intracellular domain (BRI2 ICD) released in the cytosol. Shedding by ADAM10 facilitates intramembrane cleavage but is not absolutely required for BRI2 ICD generation.; PTM: Glycosylation at Asn-170 is important for cell surface localization, but doesn't affect furin- and ADAM10-induced proteolytic processing. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21752865}.

Q9NY65	reviewed	TUBA8 TUBAL2	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.

Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Autophosphorylation occurs in a sequential manner, where Tyr-992 in the kinase activation loop is phosphorylated first, followed by autophosphorylation at Tyr-1108 and at additional tyrosine residues. ANGPT1-induced phosphorylation is impaired during hypoxia, due to increased expression of ANGPT2. Phosphorylation is important for interaction with GRB14, PIK3R1 and PTPN11. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1102 is important for interaction with SHC1, GRB2 and GRB7. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1108 is important for interaction with DOK2 and for coupling to downstream signal transduction pathways in endothelial cells.

O95863	reviewed	SNAI1 SNAH	PTM: Phosphorylated by GSK3B. Once phosphorylated, it becomes a target for BTRC ubiquitination. Phosphorylation by CSNK1E, probably at Ser-104, provides the priming site for the subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B, probably at Ser-100 and Ser-96. Phosphorylation by PAK1 may modulate its transcriptional activity by promoting increased accumulation in the nucleus. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 and Ser-92 positively regulates its functions in induction of EMT and cell survival, respectively. Phosphorylation by LATS2, upon mitotic stress, oncogenic stress or Hippo pathway activation, occurs in the nucleus and promotes nuclear retention and stabilization of total cellular protein level. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15647282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19923321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20305697, ECO:0000305|PubMed:15448698}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated on Lys-98, Lys-137 and Lys-146 by FBXL14 and BTRC leading to degradation. BTRC-triggered ubiquitination requires previous GSK3B-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation. Ubiquitination induced upon interaction with NOTCH1 or TP53/p53 is mediated by MDM2.; PTM: O-GlcNAcylation at Ser-112 is enhanced in hyperglycaemic conditions, it opposes phosphorylation by GSK3B, and stabilizes the protein.; PTM: ADP-ribosylation by PARP1 increases protein half-life and may be involved in TGFB-induced SNAI1 up-regulation.

Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen.

In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

Q9H853	reviewed	TUBA4B TUBA4	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group. Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated in its N-terminal half in an EGFR-dependent manner. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. Inactive form is mostly monoubiquitinated, but polyubiquitination happens too. Ubiquitination is increased in EGF-stimulated cells. Ubiquitination of active form is undetectable, suggesting a possibility that USP8 deubiquitinates itself, thereby regulating its own function (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

P02774	reviewed	GC	PTM: Allele GC*1S is O-glycosylated at Thr-436 (PubMed:20079467). The trisaccharide sugar moiety can be modified by the successive removal of neuraminic acid and galactose leaving an O-mceeN-acetyl-galactosamine. This conversion is thought to produce a macrophage-activating factor (Gc-MAF). Only a minor proportion of plasma GC is O-glycosylated (PubMed:17360250). The potential N-glycosylation site predicted at Asn-288 is thought to be nonglycosylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20079467, ECO:0000305|PubMed:16302727}.

O94763	reviewed	URI1 C19orf2 NNX3 PPP1R19 RMP URI	PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation occurs essentially on serine residues. Phosphorylation occurs in response to androgen treatment in prostate cancer cells in a mTOR-dependent manner. Phosphorylated; hyperhosphorylated in mitochondria in a mTORC-dependent signaling pathway. Phosphorylated at Ser-372 by RPS6KB1 in a growth factor- and rapamycin-dependent manner. S6K1-mediated mitochondrial phosphorylation at Ser-372 disrupts the URI1-PPP1CC complex in the mitochondrion, relieves PPP1CC phosphatase inhibition activity and hence engages a negative feedback diminishing RPS6KB1 kinase activity, preventing sustained S6K1-dependent signaling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17936702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21397856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21730289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9878255}.

Cleavage is crucial for limiting TNF-induced apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammatory response (PubMed:31827281, PubMed:31827280). Cleavage abolishes NF-kappa-B activation and enhances the interaction of TRADD with FADD (PubMed:10521396). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827281}.; PTM: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:18408713, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:31827280). Phosphorylation of Ser-161 by RIPK3 is necessary for the formation of the necroptosis-inducing complex (PubMed:18408713). Phosphorylation at Ser-25 represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (PubMed:30988283). Phosphorylated at Ser-320 by MAP3K7 which requires prior ubiquitination with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2 (By similarity). This phosphorylation positively regulates RIPK1 interaction with RIPK3 to promote necroptosis but negatively regulates RIPK1 kinase activity and its interaction with FADD to mediate apoptosis (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30988283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827280}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-48'-, 'Lys-63'- and linear-linked type ubiquitin (PubMed:15258597, PubMed:16603398, PubMed:18450452, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21931591, PubMed:29883609, Ref.33). Polyubiquitination with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by TRAF2 induces association with the IKK complex (PubMed:15258597). Deubiquitination of 'Lys-63'-linked chains and polyubiquitination with 'Lys-48'-linked chains by TNFAIP3 leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently down-regulates TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:15258597). 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination by RFFL or RNF34 also promotes proteasomal degradation and negatively regulates TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:18450452, Ref.33). Linear polyubiquitinated; the head-to-tail linear polyubiquitination ('Met-1'-linked) is mediated by the LUBAC complex and decreases protein kinase activity (PubMed:21455173). Deubiquitination of linear polyubiquitin by CYLD promotes the kinase activity (By similarity). Polyubiquitinated with 'Lys-48' and 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2, leading to activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21931591). Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by PELI1 (PubMed:29883609). Ubiquitination at Lys-377 with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2 is essential for its phosphorylation at Ser-320 mediated by MAP3K7 (By similarity). This ubiquitination is required for NF-kB activation, suppresses RIPK1 kinase activity and plays a critical role in preventing cell death during embryonic development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15258597, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16603398, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18450452, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21931591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29883609, ECO:0000269|Ref.33}.

'Lys-48'-autoubiquitination leads to degradation by the proteasome, while MAP3K1-induced 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination results in the stabilization of the protein (PubMed:20852630). 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitinations occur most probably on the same 3 C-terminal lysine residues (Lys-195, Lys-223 and Lys-224) and are thus mutually exclusive (PubMed:20852630).

P50552	reviewed	VASP	PTM: Major substrate for cAMP-dependent (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in platelets. The preferred site for PKA is Ser-157, the preferred site for PKG/PRKG1, Ser-239. In ADP-activated platelets, phosphorylation by PKA or PKG on Ser-157 leads to fibrinogen receptor inhibition. Phosphorylation on Thr-278 requires prior phosphorylation on Ser-157 and Ser-239. In response to phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation, phosphorylated by PKC/PRKCA. In response to thrombin, phosphorylated by both PKC and ROCK1. Phosphorylation at Thr-278 by AMPK does not require prior phosphorylation at Ser-157 or Ser-239. Phosphorylation at Ser-157 by PKA is required for localization to the tight junctions in epithelial cells. Phosphorylation modulates F-actin binding, actin filament elongation and platelet activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-322 by AMPK also alters actin filament binding. Carbon monoxide (CO) promotes phosphorylation at Ser-157, while nitric oxide (NO) promotes phosphorylation at Ser-157, but also at Ser-239. Response to NO and CO is blunted in platelets from diabetic patients, and VASP is not phosphorylated efficiently at Ser-157 and Ser-239. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16197368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17082196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18559661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7925440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8182057}.

P08069	reviewed	IGF1R	PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Autophosphorylation occurs in a sequential manner; Tyr-1165 is predominantly phosphorylated first, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr-1161 and Tyr-1166. While every single phosphorylation increases kinase activity, all three tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop (Tyr-1165, Tyr-1161 and Tyr-1166) have to be phosphorylated for optimal activity. Can be autophosphorylated at additional tyrosine residues (in vitro). Autophosphorylated is followed by phosphorylation of juxtamembrane tyrosines and C-terminal serines. Phosphorylation of Tyr-980 is required for IRS1- and SHC1-binding. Phosphorylation of Ser-1278 by GSK-3beta restrains kinase activity and promotes cell surface expression, it requires a priming phosphorylation at Ser-1282. Dephosphorylated by PTPN1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated at Lys-1168 and Lys-1171 through both 'Lys-48' and 'Lys-29' linkages, promoting receptor endocytosis and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.

Q9H4D0	reviewed	CLSTN2 CS2	PTM: Proteolytically processed under normal cellular conditions. A primary zeta-cleavage generates a large extracellular (soluble) N-terminal domain (sAlc) and a short C-terminal transmembrane fragment (CTF1). A secondary cleavage catalyzed by gamma-secretase within the transmembrane domain releases the beta-Alc-gamma chain in the extracellular milieu and produces an intracellular fragment (AlcICD). This processing is strongly suppressed in the tripartite complex formed with APBA2 and APP, which seems to prevent the association with PSEN1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro.

Phosphorylated by ATM in response to ionizing irradiation. ATM and ATR can both phosphorylate Ser-317 and Ser-345 and this results in enhanced kinase activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-345 induces a change in the conformation of the protein, activates the kinase activity and is a prerequisite for interaction with FBXO6 and subsequent ubiquitination at Lys-436. Phosphorylation at Ser-345 also increases binding to 14-3-3 proteins and promotes nuclear retention. Conversely, dephosphorylation at Ser-345 by PPM1D may contribute to exit from checkpoint mediated cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation at Ser-280 by AKT1/PKB, may promote mono and/or diubiquitination. Also phosphorylated at undefined residues during mitotic arrest, resulting in decreased activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10859164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11390642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12446774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12588868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12660173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14657349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14681223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15650047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716789}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated.

'Lys-63' ubiquitination by RNF135, which occurs after RNA-binding and homodimerization, releases the autoinhibition of the CARD domains by the RLR CTR domain, an essential step in the activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway (PubMed:23950712, PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). Lys-172 is the critical site of ubiquitination for MAVS/IPS1 binding and to induce anti-viral signal transduction (PubMed:17392790, PubMed:30193849). Lys-154, Lys-164 and Lys-172 are shared sites for RNF135-mediated and TRIM4-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19017631, PubMed:19484123, PubMed:24755855).

Within a negative feedback loop involving SIGLEC10 and PTPN11, 'Lys-48' ubiquitination at Lys-812 by CBL also elicits the proteasomal degradation of DDX58 (By similarity).

Q12778	reviewed	FOXO1 FKHR FOXO1A	PTM: Phosphorylation by NLK promotes nuclear export and inhibits the transcriptional activity. In response to growth factors, phosphorylation on Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-322 by PKB/AKT1 promotes nuclear export and inactivation of transactivational activity. Phosphorylation on Thr-24 is required for binding 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser-256 decreases DNA-binding activity and promotes the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319, permitting phosphorylation of Ser-322 and Ser-325, probably by CDK1, leading to nuclear exclusion and loss of function. Stress signals, such as response to oxygen or nitric oxide, attenuate the PKB/AKT1-mediated phosphorylation leading to nuclear retention. Phosphorylation of Ser-329 is independent of IGF1 and leads to reduced function. Dephosphorylated on Thr-24 and Ser-256 by PP2A in beta-cells under oxidative stress leading to nuclear retention (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Ser-249 by CDK1 disrupts binding of 14-3-3 proteins leading to nuclear accumulation and has no effect on DNA-binding nor transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by STK4/MST1 on Ser-212, upon oxidative stress, inhibits binding to 14-3-3 proteins and nuclear export. PPIA/CYPA promotes its dephosphorylation on Ser-256 (PubMed:31063815). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R1E0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11311120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11980723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18356527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18786403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19221179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21245099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31063815}.; PTM: Acetylated.

Acetylation diminishes the interaction with target DNA and attenuates the transcriptional activity. It increases the phosphorylation at Ser-256. Deacetylation by SIRT1 results in reactivation of the transcriptional activity. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide treatment appears to promote deacetylation and uncoupling of insulin-induced phosphorylation. By contrast, resveratrol acts independently of acetylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11980723}.

Accumulation of fumarate promotes the formation of cysteine S-succination (S-(2-succinyl)cysteine), leading to inactivate the BCR(KEAP1) complex and promote NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and activation (By similarity). Nitric oxide-dependent 8-Nitro-cGMP formation promotes cysteine guanylation (S-cGMP-cysteine), leading to NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and activation (By similarity). Itaconate, an anti-inflammatory metabolite generated in response to lipopolysaccharide, alkylates cysteines, activating NFE2L2/NRF2 (PubMed:29590092). Methylglyoxal, a reactive metabolite that accumulates when the glycolytic enzyme PGK1 is inhibited, promotes formation of a methylimidazole cross-link between proximal Cys-151 and Arg-135 on another KEAP1 molecule, resulting in an inactive dimer that inactivates the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:30323285). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2X8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17127771, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18251510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29590092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30323285}.; PTM: Degraded via a proteasomal-independent process during selective autophagy: interaction with phosphorylated SQSTM1/p62 sequesters KEAP1 in inclusion bodies, leading to its degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15983046, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972}.; PTM: Auto-ubiquitinated by the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:15572695, PubMed:15983046).

The gamma-secretase-dependent proteolytical processing occurs after the bulk of the extracellular domain has been shed, in a furin-dependent manner, in alternatively spliced isoforms carrying the furin cleavage site. Hypoglycosylation (mainly hypo-O-glycosylation) leads to increased extracellular cleavage, which in turn results in accelerating release of the intracellular domain (ICD) by the gamma-secretase.

Q93079	reviewed	H2BC9 H2BFJ HIST1H2BH	PTM: Monoubiquitination at Lys-35 (H2BK34Ub) by the MSL1/MSL2 dimer is required for histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) methylation and transcription activation at specific gene loci, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci. Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons (PubMed:16627869). Monoubiquitinated by DTX3L upon encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-mediated infection (PubMed:26479788). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

Not sumoylated when expressed in xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells (PubMed:17693262). Sumoylation inactivates the channel, but does not interfere with expression at the cell membrane (PubMed:15820677). Sumoylation of a single subunit is sufficient to silence the dimeric channel (PubMed:20498050, PubMed:23169818). Sumoylation of KCNK1 is sufficient to silence heterodimeric channels formed by KCNK1 and KCNK3 or KCNK9 (PubMed:23169818). Desumoylated by SENP1; this activates the channel (PubMed:15820677, PubMed:20498050, PubMed:23169818).

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998). H2AK119Ub and ionizing radiation-induced 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub) are distinct events. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15386022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16359901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22713238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22980979, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24352239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25470042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27083998}.; PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-2 (H2AS1ph) is enhanced during mitosis.

Phosphorylated on Ser-121 by MAPKAPK2; this phosphorylation promotes interaction with HSP90 proteins and inhibits HSF1 homotrimerization, DNA-binding and transactivation activities (PubMed:16278218). Phosphorylation on Ser-303 by GSK3B/GSK3-beta and on Ser-307 by MAPK3 within the regulatory domain is involved in the repression of HSF1 transcriptional activity and occurs in a RAF1-dependent manner (PubMed:8946918, PubMed:8940068, PubMed:9121459, PubMed:9535852, PubMed:10747973, PubMed:12646186). Phosphorylation on Ser-303 and Ser-307 increases HSF1 nuclear export in a YWHAE- and XPO1/CRM1-dependent manner (PubMed:12917326). Phosphorylation on Ser-307 is a prerequisite for phosphorylation on Ser-303 (PubMed:8940068). According to PubMed:9535852, Ser-303 is not phosphorylated in unstressed cells. Phosphorylated on Ser-419 by PLK1; phosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation upon heat shock (PubMed:15661742). Hyperphosphorylated upon heat shock and during the attenuation and recovery phase period of the heat shock response (PubMed:11447121, PubMed:12659875, PubMed:24581496).

The average density ranges from about 50% in human milk to over 90% in T47D breast cancer cells. Further sialylation occurs during recycling. Membrane-shed glycoproteins from kidney and breast cancer cells have preferentially sialyated core 1 structures, while secreted forms from the same tissues display mainly core 2 structures. The O-glycosylated content is overlapping in both these tissues with terminal fucose and galactose, 2- and 3-linked galactose, 3- and 3,6-linked GalNAc-ol and 4-linked GlcNAc predominating. Differentially O-glycosylated in breast carcinomas with 3,4-linked GlcNAc. N-glycosylation consists of high-mannose, acidic complex-type and hybrid glycans in the secreted form MUC1/SEC, and neutral complex-type in the transmembrane form, MUC1/TM. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10373415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7744025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9312074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9597769}.; PTM: Proteolytic cleavage in the SEA domain occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum by an autoproteolytic mechanism and requires the full-length SEA domain as well as requiring a Ser, Thr or Cys residue at the P + 1 site.

Such aggregates can be observed in vivo in the affected tissues of patients with Alzheimer disease or alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or in cell cultures during necrosis. Oxidation at Met-46 may play a pivotal role in the formation of these insoluble structures. This modification has been detected in vitro following treatment with free radical donor (+/-)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexenamide. It has been proposed to destabilize nearby residues, increasing the likelihood of secondary oxidative damages, including oxidation of Tyr-45 and Met-105. This cascade of oxidations may augment GAPDH misfolding, leading to intermolecular disulfide cross-linking and aggregation. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:25086035}.; PTM: Succination of Cys-152 and Cys-247 by the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, which leads to S-(2-succinyl)cysteine residues, inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Fumarate concentration as well as succination of cysteine residues in GAPDH is significantly increased in muscle of diabetic mammals. It was proposed that the S-(2-succinyl)cysteine chemical modification may be a useful biomarker of mitochondrial and oxidative stress in diabetes and that succination of GAPDH and other thiol proteins by fumarate may contribute to the metabolic changes underlying the development of diabetes complications. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04797}.

Phosphorylated on Ser-168 and Ser-170 by MTOR, IRAK1, MAPK7/ERK5 and MAPK14/p38, on Ser-213 and Ser-217 by MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2, and on Ser-289 and Ser-344 by RPS6KA3 (PubMed:11997522, PubMed:17875713, PubMed:17213202, PubMed:18347059). Phosphorylated by GSK3B (PubMed:18347059). Phosphorylation by GSK3B markedly increases NFATC4 ubiquitination (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-168 and Ser-170 is stimulated by UV irradiation (PubMed:18347059). Phosphorylation determines subcellular location: the hyperphosphorylated protein is cytosolic, while the dephosphorylated form is targeted to the nucleus. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:D3Z9H7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11997522, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17213202, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17875713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18347059}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated, leading to degradation by the proteasome.

Q15303	reviewed	ERBB4 HER4	PTM: Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-A CYT-2 are processed by ADAM17. Proteolytic processing in response to ligand or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation results in the production of 120 kDa soluble receptor forms and intermediate membrane-anchored 80 kDa fragments (m80HER4), which are further processed by a presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase to release a cytoplasmic intracellular domain (E4ICD; E4ICD1/s80Cyt1 or E4ICD2/s80Cyt2, depending on the isoform). Membrane-anchored 80 kDa fragments of the processed isoform JM-A CYT-1 are more readily degraded by the proteasome than fragments of isoform JM-A CYT-2, suggesting a prevalence of E4ICD2 over E4ICD1. Isoform JM-B CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-2 lack the ADAM17 cleavage site and are not processed by ADAM17, precluding further processing by gamma-secretase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10744726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12807903, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15746097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16837552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17638867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9334263}.; PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Ligands trigger phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, thereby creating binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Constitutively phosphorylated at a basal level when overexpressed in heterologous systems; ligand binding leads to increased phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1035 is important for interaction with STAT1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1056 is important for interaction with PIK3R1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1242 is important for interaction with SHC1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1188 may also contribute to the interaction with SHC1. Isoform JM-A CYT-2 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a ligand-independent manner. E4ICD2 but not E4ICD1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17120616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17486069, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18721752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19098003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8617750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9168115}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. During mitosis, the ERBB4 intracellular domain is ubiquitinated by the APC/C complex and targeted to proteasomal degradation. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 are ubiquitinated by WWP1.

Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11709551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

Phosphorylated by PLK1, leading to activate the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation by PLK3 at Ser-191 promotes nuclear translocation. Ser-198 is a minor phosphorylation site. Was initially reported to be phosphorylated by PLK3 at Ser-216 (PubMed:10557092). However, such phosphorylation by PLK3 was not confirmed by other groups. Phosphorylation at Thr-48, Thr-67, Ser-122, Thr-130, Ser-168 and Ser-214 occurs at G2 and G2-M transition and is probably catalyzed by CDK1. Ser-168 phosphorylation levels are lower than those at the other 5 CDK1 sites.

Cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment N(TM) and a N-terminal fragment N(EC). Following ligand binding, it is cleaved by ADAM17 to yield a membrane-associated intermediate fragment called notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) (PubMed:24226769). Following endocytosis, this fragment is then cleaved by one of the catalytic subunits of gamma-secretase (PSEN1 or PSEN2), to release a Notch-derived peptide containing the intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane (PubMed:30598546). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01705, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30598546}.; PTM: Phosphorylated. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: O-glycosylated on the EGF-like domains (PubMed:24226769).

Contains both O-linked fucose and O-linked glucose in the EGF-like domains 11, 12 and 13, which are interacting with the residues on DLL4 (By similarity). O-linked glycosylation by GALNT11 is involved in determination of left/right symmetry: glycosylation promotes activation of NOTCH1, possibly by promoting cleavage by ADAM17, modulating the balance between motile and immotile (sensory) cilia at the left-right organiser (LRO) (PubMed:24226769). MFNG-, RFNG- and LFNG-mediated modification of O-fucose residues at specific EGF-like domains results in inhibition of its activation by JAG1 and enhancement of its activation by DLL1 via an increased binding to DLL1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01705, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q07008, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30127001}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated.

Monoubiquitination at Lys-1759 is required for activation by gamma-secretase cleavage, it promotes interaction with AAK1, which stabilizes it. Deubiquitination by EIF3F is necessary for nuclear import of activated Notch (PubMed:24226769). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18628966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23886940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769}.; PTM: Hydroxylated at Asn-1955 by HIF1AN.

Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4.

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by chromatin-associated CHEK1 regulates the transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes by modulating acetylation of Lys-10 (H3K9ac). Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10464286, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11242053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11856369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12560483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15681610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15684425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16185088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16457588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17194708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18066052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18243098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19783980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20228790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20850016}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated by RAG1 in lymphoid cells, monoubiquitination is required for V(D)J recombination (By similarity).

Q02078	reviewed	MEF2A MEF2	PTM: Constitutive phosphorylation on Ser-408 promotes Lys-403 sumoylation thus preventing acetylation at this site. Dephosphorylation on Ser-408 by PPP3CA upon neuron depolarization promotes a switch from sumoylation to acetylation on residue Lys-403 leading to inhibition of dendrite claw differentiation. Phosphorylation on Thr-312 and Thr-319 are the main sites involved in p38 MAPK signaling and activate transcription.

Cleavage at the GPS domain occurs through a cis-autoproteolytic mechanism involving an ester-intermediate via N-O acyl rearrangement. This process takes place in the early secretory pathway, depends on initial N-glycosylation, and requires the REJ domain. There is evidence that cleavage at GPS domain is incomplete.

P06401	reviewed	PGR NR3C3	PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple serine sites. Several of these sites are hormone-dependent. Phosphorylation on Ser-294 occurs preferentially on isoform B, is highly hormone-dependent and modulates ubiquitination and sumoylation on Lys-388. Phosphorylation on Ser-102 and Ser-345 also requires induction by hormone. Basal phosphorylation on Ser-81, Ser-162, Ser-190 and Ser-400 is increased in response to progesterone and can be phosphorylated in vitro by the CDK2-A1 complex. Increased levels of phosphorylation on Ser-400 also in the presence of EGF, heregulin, IGF, PMA and FBS. Phosphorylation at this site by CDK2 is ligand-independent, and increases nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-162 and Ser-294, but not at Ser-190, is impaired during the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation on Ser-345 by ERK1/2 MAPK is required for interaction with SP1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10628747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10655479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11110801, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15572662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15798179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17020914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17173941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17347654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17717077, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18202149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7476977, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8702648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9171245}.; PTM: Sumoylation is hormone-dependent and represses transcriptional activity.

Cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment N(TM) and a N-terminal fragment N(EC) (By similarity). Following ligand binding, it is cleaved by TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) to yield a membrane-associated intermediate fragment called notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) (By similarity). This fragment is then cleaved by presenilin dependent gamma-secretase to release a notch-derived peptide containing the intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35516, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01705}.; PTM: Hydroxylated by HIF1AN. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18299578}.; PTM: Can be either O-glucosylated or O-xylosylated at Ser-613 by POGLUT1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35516}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by GSK3.

Q9UG56	reviewed	PISD	PTM: Is synthesized initially as an inactive proenzyme. Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The autoendoproteolytic cleavage occurs by a canonical serine protease mechanism, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain. During this reaction, the Ser that is part of the protease active site of the proenzyme becomes the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, which constitutes an essential element of the active site of the mature decarboxylase. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03208}.

Phosphorylation decreases with age. Phosphorylation within tau/MAP's repeat domain or in flanking regions seems to reduce tau/MAP's interaction with, respectively, microtubules or plasma membrane components (PubMed:7706316). Phosphorylation on Ser-610, Ser-622, Ser-641 and Ser-673 in several isoforms during mitosis. Phosphorylation at Ser-548 by GSK3B reduces ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. Phosphorylation at Ser-579 by BRSK1 and BRSK2 in neurons affects ability to bind microtubules and plays a role in neuron polarization. Phosphorylated at Ser-554, Ser-579, Ser-602, Ser-606 and Ser-669 by PHK. Phosphorylation at Ser-214 by SGK1 mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. There is a reciprocal down-regulation of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Phosphorylation on Ser-717 completely abolishes the O-GlcNAcylation on this site, while phosphorylation on Ser-713 and Ser-721 reduces glycosylation by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively. Phosphorylation on Ser-721 is reduced by about 41.5% by GlcNAcylation on Ser-717.

Glycation is a non-enzymatic post-translational modification that involves a covalent linkage between a sugar and an amino group of a protein molecule forming ketoamine. Subsequent oxidation, fragmentation and/or cross-linking of ketoamine leads to the production of advanced glycation endproducts (AGES).

P24928	reviewed	POLR2A POLR2	PTM: The tandem heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) can be highly phosphorylated (PubMed:28076779). The phosphorylation activates Pol II. Phosphorylation occurs mainly at residues 'Ser-2' and 'Ser-5' of the heptapeptide repeat and is mediated, at least, by CDK7 and CDK9. CDK7 phosphorylation of POLR2A associated with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Phosphorylation also takes place at 'Ser-7' of the heptapeptide repeat, which is required for efficient transcription of snRNA genes and processing of the transcripts. The phosphorylation state is believed to result from the balanced action of site-specific CTD kinases and phosphatases, and a 'CTD code' that specifies the position of Pol II within the transcription cycle has been proposed. Dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase CTDSP1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17234882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19136461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19450536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21127351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22137580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28076779}.; PTM: Among tandem heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) some do not match the Y-S-P-T-S-P-S consensus, the seventh serine residue 'Ser-7' being replaced by a lysine. 'Lys-7' in these non-consensus heptapeptide repeats can be alternatively acetylated, methylated and dimethylated. EP300 is one of the enzyme able to acetylate 'Lys-7'. Acetylation at 'Lys-7' of non-consensus heptapeptide repeats is associated with 'Ser-2' phosphorylation and active transcription. Regulates initiation or early elongation steps of transcription specially for inducible genes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24207025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26687004}.; PTM: Methylated at Arg-1810 prior to transcription initiation when the CTD is hypophosphorylated, phosphorylation at Ser-1805 and Ser-1808 preventing this methylation. Symmetrically or asymmetrically dimethylated at Arg-1810 by PRMT5 and CARM1 respectively. Symmetric or asymmetric dimethylation modulates interactions with CTD-binding proteins like SMN1/SMN2 and TDRD3. SMN1/SMN2 interacts preferentially with the symmetrically dimethylated form while TDRD3 interacts with the asymmetric form. Through the recruitment of SMN1/SMN2, symmetric dimethylation is required for resolving RNA-DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II, that form R-loop in transcription terminal regions, an important step in proper transcription termination. CTD dimethylation may also facilitate the expression of select RNAs. Among tandem heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) some do not match the Y-S-P-T-S-P-S consensus, the seventh serine residue 'Ser-7' being replaced by a lysine. 'Lys-7' in these non-consensus heptapeptide repeats can be alternatively acetylated, methylated, dimethylated and trimethylated. Methylation occurs in the earliest transcription stages and precedes or is concomitant to 'Ser-5' and 'Ser-7' phosphorylation. Dimethylation and trimehtylation at 'Lys-7' of non-consensus heptapeptide repeats are exclusively associated with phosphorylated CTD. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26687004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26700805}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by WWP2 leading to proteasomal degradation (By similarity).

Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella).

It also diminishes its cleavage by caspases and its ability to phosphorylate FOXO3. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15109305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19940129}.; PTM: Proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis at Asp-326 and Asp-349 resulting in a 37 kDa or a 39 kDa subunit respectively. The 39 kDa subunit is further cleaved into the 37 kDa form. Proteolytic cleavage results in kinase activation and nuclear translocation of the truncated form (MST1/N). It is less likely that cleavage at Asp-349 is a prerequisite for activation as this site is not conserved in the murine ortholog. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278283}.

Monoubiquitination at Lys-492 by the BCR(KLHL22) ubiquitin ligase complex does not lead to degradation: it promotes PLK1 dissociation from phosphoreceptor proteins and subsequent removal from kinetochores, allowing silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and chromosome segregation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18662541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23455478}.

P12004	reviewed	PCNA	PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation at Tyr-211 by EGFR stabilizes chromatin-associated PCNA. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17115032}.; PTM: Acetylated by CREBBP and p300/EP300; preferentially acetylated by CREBBP on Lys-80, Lys-13 and Lys-14 and on Lys-77 by p300/EP300 upon loading on chromatin in response to UV irradiation (PubMed:24939902, PubMed:19419956). Lysine acetylation disrupts association with chromatin, hence promoting PCNA ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in response to UV damage in a CREBBP- and EP300-dependent manner (PubMed:24939902). Acetylation disrupts interaction with NUDT15 and promotes degradation (PubMed:19419956). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated (PubMed:24939902, PubMed:20227374). Following DNA damage, can be either monoubiquitinated to stimulate direct bypass of DNA lesions by specialized DNA polymerases or polyubiquitinated to promote recombination-dependent DNA synthesis across DNA lesions by template switching mechanisms. Following induction of replication stress, monoubiquitinated by the UBE2B-RAD18 complex on Lys-164, leading to recruit translesion (TLS) polymerases, which are able to synthesize across DNA lesions in a potentially error-prone manner. An error-free pathway also exists and requires non-canonical polyubiquitination on Lys-164 through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 complex UBE2N-UBE2V2 and the E3 ligases, HLTF, RNF8 and SHPRH. This error-free pathway, also known as template switching, employs recombination mechanisms to synthesize across the lesion, using as a template the undamaged, newly synthesized strand of the sister chromatid. Monoubiquitination at Lys-164 also takes place in undamaged proliferating cells, and is mediated by the DCX(DTL) complex, leading to enhance PCNA-dependent translesion DNA synthesis. Sumoylated during S phase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15149598, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17130289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18316726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18719106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18948756, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20129063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20227374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22153967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.; PTM: Methylated on glutamate residues by ARMT1/C6orf211. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25732820}.

P09619	reviewed	PDGFRB PDGFR PDGFR1	PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Phosphorylation at Tyr-579, and to a lesser degree, at Tyr-581, is important for interaction with SRC family kinases. Phosphorylation at Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 is important for interaction with PIK3R1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-751 is important for interaction with NCK1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-771 and Tyr-857 is important for interaction with RASA1/GAP. Phosphorylation at Tyr-857 is important for efficient phosphorylation of PLCG1 and PTPN11, resulting in increased phosphorylation of AKT1, MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, PDCD6IP/ALIX and STAM, and in increased cell proliferation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1009 is important for interaction with PTPN11. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1009 and Tyr-1021 is important for interaction with PLCG1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1021 is important for interaction with CBL; PLCG1 and CBL compete for the same binding site. Dephosphorylated by PTPRJ at Tyr-751, Tyr-857, Tyr-1009 and Tyr-1021.

P04049	reviewed	RAF1 RAF	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-269, Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491 and Ser-494 results in its activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-29, Ser-43, Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301 and Ser-642 by MAPK1/ERK2 results in its inactivation. Phosphorylation at Ser-259 induces the interaction with YWHAZ and inactivates kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of Ser-259 by the complex containing protein phosphatase 1, SHOC2 and M-Ras/MRAS relieves inactivation, leading to stimulate RAF1 activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-338 by PAK1 and PAK5 and Ser-339 by PAK1 is required for its mitochondrial localization. Phosphorylation at Ser-621 in response to growth factor treatment stabilizes the protein, possibly by preventing proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation at Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301, Ser-338 and Ser-621 are somehow linked to the methylation potential of cells. Treatment of cells with HGF in the presence of the methylation inhibitor 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) results in increased phosphorylation at Ser-338 and Ser-621 and decreased phosphorylation at Ser-296, Ser-301 and Ser-338.

Q99969	reviewed	RARRES2 TIG2	PTM: Secreted in an inactive precursor form, prochemerin, which is proteolytically processed by a variety of extracellular proteases to generate forms with differing levels of bioactivity. For example, the removal of six amino acids results in chemerin-157, which exhibits the highest activity, while removal of seven amino acids results in chemerin-156 which has slightly less activity. Some proteases are able to cleave at more than one site and chemerin forms may be sequentially processed by different enzymes to modulate activity levels. The coordinated expression and activity of chemerin-modifying enzymes is essential for regulating its bioactivation, inactivation and, consequently, biological function. Cathepsin G cleaves seven C-terminal amino acids from prochemerin (chemerin-156), elastase is able to cleave six (chemerin-157), eight (chemerin-155) or eleven (chemerin-152), plasmin cleaves five amino acids (chemerin-158), and tryptase cleaves five (chemerin-158) or eight (chemerin-155). Multiple cleavages might be required to fully activate chemerin, with an initial tryptase cleavage resulting in chemerin with low activity (chemerin-158), and a second cleavage by carboxypeptidase N or B producing highly active chemerin (chemerin-157). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14675762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16096270}.

Lysine acetylation promotes ubiquitination by UBR5 (PubMed:21726808). Acetylation is enhanced in the presence of BAG6. Deacetylated by SIRT2. Deacetylation of Lys-91 is carried out by SIRT1 and depends on PCK1 phosphorylation levels (PubMed:30193097). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20167786, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21726808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30193097}.; PTM: Phosphorylated in a GSK3B-mediated pathway; phosphorylation affects the efficiency of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation, and regulates PCK1 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:30193097).

The four subunits in a tetramer probably differ in the extent of glycosylation; simultaneous glycosylation of all experimentally validated sites would probably create steric hindrance. Thus, glycosylation at Asn-305 is not compatible with glycosylation at Asn-328; only one of these two residues is glycosylated at a given time. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28092368}.

Q13885	reviewed	TUBB2A TUBB2	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Monomethylation at Lys-310 is recognized by the ANK repeats of EHMT1 and promotes the formation of repressed chromatin at target genes, leading to down-regulation of NF-kappa-B transcription factor activity.

P08047	reviewed	SP1 TSFP1	PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues. Phosphorylation is coupled to ubiquitination, sumoylation and proteolytic processing. Phosphorylation on Ser-59 enhances proteolytic cleavage. Phosphorylation on Ser-7 enhances ubiquitination and protein degradation. Hyperphosphorylation on Ser-101 in response to DNA damage has no effect on transcriptional activity. MAPK1/MAPK3-mediated phosphorylation on Thr-453 and Thr-739 enhances VEGF transcription but, represses FGF2-triggered PDGFR-alpha transcription. Also implicated in the repression of RECK by ERBB2. Hyperphosphorylated on Thr-278 and Thr-739 during mitosis by MAPK8 shielding SP1 from degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Phosphorylated in the zinc-finger domain by calmodulin-activated PKCzeta. Phosphorylation on Ser-641 by PKCzeta is critical for TSA-activated LHR gene expression through release of its repressor, p107. Phosphorylation on Thr-668, Ser-670 and Thr-681 is stimulated by angiotensin II via the AT1 receptor inducing increased binding to the PDGF-D promoter. This phosphorylation is increased in injured artey wall. Ser-59 and Thr-681 can both be dephosphorylated by PP2A during cell-cycle interphase. Dephosphorylation on Ser-59 leads to increased chromatin association during interphase and increases the transcriptional activity. On insulin stimulation, sequentially glycosylated and phosphorylated on several C-terminal serine and threonine residues. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11904305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16332679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16377629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16943418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17049555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18171990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18199680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18258854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18619531}.; PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation/deacetylation events affect transcriptional activity. Deacetylation leads to an increase in the expression the 12(s)-lipooxygenase gene though recruitment of p300 to the promoter. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16478997}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination occurs on the C-terminal proteolytically-cleaved peptide and is triggered by phosphorylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239466}.; PTM: Sumoylated with SUMO1. Sumoylation modulates proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal repressor domain. Sumoylation levels are attenuated during tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation mediates SP1 desumoylation.; PTM: Proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal repressor domain is prevented by sumoylation. The C-terminal cleaved product is susceptible to degradation.; PTM: O-glycosylated; Contains 8 N-acetylglucosamine side chains. Levels are controlled by insulin and the SP1 phosphorylation states. Insulin-mediated O-glycosylation locates SP1 to the nucleus, where it is sequentially deglycosylated and phosphorylated. O-glycosylation affects transcriptional activity through disrupting the interaction with a number of transcription factors including ELF1 and NFYA. Also inhibits interaction with the HIV1 promoter. Inhibited by peroxisomome proliferator receptor gamma (PPARgamma).

Q9BUF5	reviewed	TUBB6	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Both activities result in the cleavage of the full-length protein and covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated N-terminal fragment (ShhN) (By similarity). Cholesterylation is required for the sonic hedgehog protein N-product targeting to lipid rafts and multimerization (PubMed:24522195, PubMed:26875496).

Phosphorylation at Thr-182 promotes autophosphorylation at Ser-186, which is required for sustained activity. Autophosphorylation at Ser-186 is maintained by sequential phosphorylation at Thr-182 by GSK3-beta. GSK3-beta cannot initiate phosphorylation at Thr-182, it can only maintain it. Phosphorylation at Ser-575 in response to cAMP signaling promotes translocation to the cytoplasm (PubMed:29211348).

P11802	reviewed	CDK4	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-172 is required for enzymatic activity. Phosphorylated, in vitro, at this site by CCNH-CDK7, but, in vivo, appears to be phosphorylated by a proline-directed kinase. In the cyclin D-CDK4-CDKN1B complex, this phosphorylation and consequent CDK4 enzyme activity, is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of CDKN1B. Thus, in proliferating cells, CDK4 within the complex is phosphorylated on Thr-172 in the T-loop. In resting cells, phosphorylation on Thr-172 is prevented by the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CDKN1B. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16782892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19075005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19237555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19237565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19487459}.

P05067	reviewed	APP A4 AD1	PTM: Proteolytically processed under normal cellular conditions. Cleavage either by alpha-secretase, beta-secretase or theta-secretase leads to generation and extracellular release of soluble APP peptides, S-APP-alpha and S-APP-beta, and the retention of corresponding membrane-anchored C-terminal fragments, C80, C83 and C99. Subsequent processing of C80 and C83 by gamma-secretase yields P3 peptides. This is the major secretory pathway and is non-amyloidogenic. Alternatively, presenilin/nicastrin-mediated gamma-secretase processing of C99 releases the amyloid-beta proteins, amyloid-beta protein 40 and amyloid-beta protein 42, major components of amyloid plaques, and the cytotoxic C-terminal fragments, gamma-CTF(50), gamma-CTF(57) and gamma-CTF(59). PSEN1 cleavage is more efficient with C83 than with C99 as substrate (in vitro) (PubMed:30630874).

Cleavage at Asp-739 by either CASP6, CASP8 or CASP9 results in the production of the neurotoxic C31 peptide and the increased production of amyloid-beta peptides. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10319819}.; PTM: N-glycosylated (PubMed:2900137). N- and O-glycosylated (PubMed:2649245). O-glycosylation on Ser and Thr residues with core 1 or possibly core 8 glycans. Partial tyrosine glycosylation (Tyr-681) is found on some minor, short amyloid-beta peptides (amyloid-beta 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19 and 1-20) but not found on amyloid-beta protein 38, amyloid-beta protein 40 nor on amyloid-beta protein 42. Modification on a tyrosine is unusual and is more prevelant in AD patients. Glycans had Neu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr, Neu5AcNeu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr and O-AcNeu5AcNeu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr structures, where O-Ac is O-acetylation of Neu5Ac. Neu5AcNeu5Ac is most likely Neu5Ac 2,8Neu5Ac linked. O-glycosylations in the vicinity of the cleavage sites may influence the proteolytic processing. Appicans are L-APP isoforms with O-linked chondroitin sulfate. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16335952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21712440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22576872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2649245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2900137}.; PTM: Phosphorylation in the C-terminal on tyrosine, threonine and serine residues is neuron-specific (PubMed:10341243).

The Thr-743 phosphorylated form causes a conformational change which reduces binding of Fe65 family members (PubMed:11517218). In dopaminergic (DA) neurons, phosphorylation on Thr-743 by LRKK2 promotes the production and the nuclear translocation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) which induces DA neuron apoptosis (PubMed:28720718). Phosphorylation on Tyr-757 is required for SHC binding (PubMed:11877420). Phosphorylated in the extracellular domain by casein kinases on both soluble and membrane-bound APP.

The toxin can be highly efficient at very low concentrations by acting on formin homology family proteins: toxic actin oligomers bind with high affinity to formins and adversely affect both nucleation and elongation abilities of formins, causing their potent inhibition in both profilin-dependent and independent manners (PubMed:26228148). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19015515, ECO:0000305|PubMed:26228148}.

Phosphorylation at Tyr-226 and Tyr-393 correlate with increased activity. DNA damage-induced activation of ABL1 requires the function of ATM and Ser-446 phosphorylation (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-569 has been attributed to a CDC2-associated kinase and is coupled to cell division (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-618 and Ser-619 by PAK2 increases binding to CRK and reduces binding to ABI1. Phosphorylation on Thr-735 is required for binding 14-3-3 proteins for cytoplasmic translocation.

Processing by the metalloproteinase, induced by calcium influx, causes disruption of cell-cell adhesion and the subsequent release of beta-catenin into the cytoplasm (PubMed:10597309). The residual membrane-tethered cleavage product is rapidly degraded via an intracellular proteolytic pathway (PubMed:10597309). Cleavage by caspase-3 releases the cytoplasmic tail resulting in disintegration of the actin microfilament system (PubMed:11076937).

P06493	reviewed	CDK1 CDC2 CDC28A CDKN1 P34CDC2	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-161 by CAK/CDK7 activates kinase activity. Phosphorylation at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by PKMYT1 prevents nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE1 and WEE2 inhibits the protein kinase activity and acts as a negative regulator of entry into mitosis (G2 to M transition). Phosphorylation by PKMYT1 and WEE1 takes place during mitosis to keep CDK1-cyclin-B complexes inactive until the end of G2. By the end of G2, PKMYT1 and WEE1 are inactivated, but CDC25A and CDC25B are activated. Dephosphorylation by active CDC25A and CDC25B at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, leads to CDK1 activation at the G2-M transition. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE2 during oogenesis is required to maintain meiotic arrest in oocytes during the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, a long period of quiescence at dictyate prophase I, leading to prevent meiotic reentry. Phosphorylation by WEE2 is also required for metaphase II exit during egg activation to ensure exit from meiosis in oocytes and promote pronuclear formation. Phosphorylated at Tyr-4 by PKR/EIF2AK2 upon genotoxic stress. This phosphorylation triggers CDK1 polyubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis, thus leading to G2 arrest. In response to UV irradiation, phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by PRKCD activates the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19917613, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20360007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3289755, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7569953}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated upon genotoxic stress. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957}.

The p65 isoform is poorly detected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9584194}.; PTM: PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylates the protein at the YDYVHL motif (conserved among all cas proteins). The SRC family kinases (FYN, SRC, LCK and CRK) are recruited to the phosphorylated sites and can phosphorylate other tyrosine residues. Ligation of either integrin beta-1 or B-cell antigen receptor on tonsillar B-cells and B-cell lines promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and both integrin and BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation requires an intact actin network. In fibroblasts transformation with oncogene v-ABL results in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Transiently phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking and this phosphorylated form binds to CRK and C3G. A mutant lacking the SH3 domain is phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking but not upon integrin beta-1 cross-linking. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs upon stimulation of the G-protein coupled C1a calcitonin receptor. Calcitonin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms and requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Phosphorylation at Ser-369 induces proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19539609}.

Q14289	reviewed	PTK2B FAK2 PYK2 RAFTK	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to various stimuli that elevate the intracellular calcium concentration; this activation is indirect and may be mediated by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tyr-402 is the major autophosphorylation site, but other kinases can also phosphorylate Tyr-402. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Phosphorylation at Tyr-402 promotes interaction with SRC and SRC family members, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr-579; Tyr-580 and Tyr-881. Phosphorylation at Tyr-881 is important for interaction with GRB2. Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation of FGR and PKC. Recruitment by NPHP1 to cell matrix adhesions initiates Tyr-402 phosphorylation. In monocytes, adherence to substrata is required for tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation. Angiotensin II, thapsigargin and L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) also induce autophosphorylation and increase kinase activity. Phosphorylation by MYLK promotes ITGB2 activation and is thus essential to trigger neutrophil transmigration during lung injury. Dephosphorylated by PTPN12. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11493697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15166227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17329398, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19207108, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20028775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20381867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20521079, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545257}.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

Fucosylation mediates the efficient secretion of ADAMTS family members. Also can be C-glycosylated with one or two mannose molecules on tryptophan residues within the consensus sequence W-X-X-W of the TPRs, and N-glycosylated.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). Acetylation at Lys-123 (H3K122ac) by EP300/p300 plays a central role in chromatin structure: localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) by PADI4 impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 is linked to gene activation.

H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me), Lys-37 (H3K36me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) are linked to gene activation. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) require preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Monomethylation at Lys-57 (H3K56me1) by EHMT2/G9A in G1 phase promotes interaction with PCNA and is required for DNA replication (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at Thr-4 (H3T3ph) by HASPIN during prophase and dephosphorylated during anaphase. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C.

H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed non-hydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl group blocking the N-terminus of the alpha chain. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10574985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2460457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2687270}.

Q16778	reviewed	H2BC21 H2BFQ HIST2H2BE	PTM: Monoubiquitination at Lys-35 (H2BK34Ub) by the MSL1/MSL2 dimer is required for histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) methylation and transcription activation at specific gene loci, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci. Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

P29317	reviewed	EPHA2 ECK	PTM: Autophosphorylates. Phosphorylated on tyrosine upon binding and activation by EFNA1. Phosphorylated residues Tyr-588 and Tyr-594 are required for binding VAV2 and VAV3 while phosphorylated residues Tyr-735 and Tyr-930 are required for binding PI3-kinase p85 subunit (PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3). These phosphorylated residues are critical for recruitment of VAV2 and VAV3 and PI3-kinase p85 subunit which transduce downstream signaling to activate RAC1 GTPase and cell migration. Dephosphorylation of Tyr-930 by PTPRF prevents the interaction of EPHA2 with NCK1. Phosphorylated at Ser-897 by PKB; serum-induced phosphorylation which targets EPHA2 to the cell leading edge and stimulates cell migration. Phosphorylation by PKB is inhibited by EFNA1-activated EPHA2 which regulates PKB activity via a reciprocal regulatory loop. Phosphorylated at Ser-897 in response to TNF by RPS6KA1 and RPS6KA3; RPS6KA-EPHA2 signaling pathway controls cell migration (PubMed:26158630).

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro.

Ubiquitination of AURKB by BCR(KLHL21) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex may not lead to its degradation by the proteasome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17543862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19995937}.

Q14118	reviewed	DAG1	PTM: [Alpha-dystroglycan]: O-glycosylated. POMGNT1 catalyzes the initial addition of N-acetylglucosamine, giving rise to the GlcNAc(beta1-2)Man(alpha1-)O-Ser/Thr moiety and thus providing the necessary basis for the addition of further carbohydrate moieties (PubMed:27493216). Heavily O-glycosylated comprising of up to two thirds of its mass and the carbohydrate composition differs depending on tissue type. Mucin-type O-glycosylation is important for ligand binding activity. O-mannosylation is found in high abundance in both brain and muscle where the most abundant glycan is Sia-alpha-2-3-Gal-beta-1-4-Glc-NAc-beta-1-2-Man. In muscle, glycosylation on Thr-317, Thr-319 and Thr-379 by a phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycan with the structure 2-(N-acetylamido)-2-deoxygalactosyl-beta-1,3-2-(N-acetylamido)-2-deoxyglucosyl-beta-1,4-6-phosphomannose is mediated by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE1) protein and is required for laminin binding (PubMed:20044576, PubMed:21987822, PubMed:24256719). The O-glycosyl hexose on Thr-367, Thr-369, Thr-372, Thr-381 and Thr-388 is probably mannose. O-glycosylated in the N-terminal region with a core 1 or possibly core 8 glycan. The brain form displays a unique glycosylation pattern which is absent in other tissues; this form shows enhanced binding to laminin LAMA5 compared to the skeletal muscle form (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O18738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12140558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16254364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17905726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19838169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20044576, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20507882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21987822, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23234360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24256719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27493216}.; PTM: [Alpha-dystroglycan]: (Microbial infection) O-mannosylation is required for binding lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Old World Lassa fever virus, and clade C New World arenaviruses. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16254364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360738}.; PTM: [Beta-dystroglycan]: N-glycosylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18764929}.; PTM: Autolytic cleavage produces the alpha and beta subunits.

Q13542	reviewed	EIF4EBP2	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-37, Thr-46, Ser-65, Thr-70 and Ser-83 is mediated by MTOR and corresponds to the hyperphosphorylated form: it abolishes binding to EIF4E by inducing folding of intrinsically disordered regions (PubMed:24207126, PubMed:25533957). First phosphorylated at Thr-37 and Thr-46 by MTOR, inducing folding of region encompassing residues from Pro-18 to Arg-62 of into a four-stranded beta-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXLPhi motif into a partly buried beta-strand, blocking accessibility to EIF4E. Protein phosphorylated at Thr-37 and Thr-46 is however unstable and subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-65, Thr-70 and Ser-83 is required to stabilize the fold, decreasing affinity for EIF4E by a factor of 4000 (PubMed:24207126, PubMed:25533957). Phosphorylated in response to insulin, EGF and PDGF. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21661078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24207126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25533957}.; PTM: Deamidated at Asn-99 and Asn-102 to aspartate (Asp) in brain. Deamidation promotes interaction with RPTOR, subsequent phosphorylation by mTORC1 and increased translation, leading to impair kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission. Deamidation takes place during postnatal development, when the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is reduced, suggesting it acts as a compensatory mechanism to promote translation despite attenuated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in neuron development. Deamidation converts Asn residues into a mixture of Asp and isoaspartate; interactions with PCMT1 is required to prevent isoaspartate accumulation and convert isoaspartate to Asp. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70445}.

Q49AN0	reviewed	CRY2 KIAA0658	PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-266 by MAPK is important for the inhibition of CLOCK-ARNTL-mediated transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by CSKNE requires interaction with PER1 or PER2. Phosphorylated in a circadian manner at Ser-554 and Ser-558 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver. Phosphorylation at Ser-558 by DYRK1A promotes subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-554 by GSK3-beta: the two-step phosphorylation at the neighboring Ser residues leads to its proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes, regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization. The SCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CRY2. In contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilize CRY2 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues. The SCF(FBXL3) complex recognizes and binds CRY2 phosphorylated at Ser-554 and Ser-558.

P46527	reviewed	CDKN1B KIP1	PTM: Phosphorylated; phosphorylation occurs on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation on Ser-10 is the major site of phosphorylation in resting cells, takes place at the G(0)-G(1) phase and leads to protein stability. Phosphorylation on other sites is greatly enhanced by mitogens, growth factors, cMYC and in certain cancer cell lines. The phosphorylated form found in the cytoplasm is inactivate. Phosphorylation on Thr-198 is required for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation on Thr-187, by CDK1 and CDK2 leads to protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Tyrosine phosphorylation promotes this process. Phosphorylation by PKB/AKT1 can be suppressed by LY294002, an inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Phosphorylation on Tyr-88 and Tyr-89 has no effect on binding CDK2, but is required for binding CDK4. Dephosphorylated on tyrosine residues by G-CSF. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10323868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10831586, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12042314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12093740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14504289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15280662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16195327, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16209941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17254966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17254967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21423214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23478441, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23707388}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated; in the cytoplasm by the KPC complex (composed of RNF123/KPC1 and UBAC1/KPC2) and, in the nucleus, by SCF(SKP2).

O95831	reviewed	AIFM1 AIF PDCD8	PTM: Under normal conditions, a 54-residue N-terminal segment is first proteolytically removed during or just after translocation into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to form the inner-membrane-anchored mature form (AIFmit). During apoptosis, it is further proteolytically processed at amino-acid position 101 leading to the generation of the mature form, which is confined to the mitochondrial IMS in a soluble form (AIFsol). AIFsol is released to the cytoplasm in response to specific death signals, and translocated to the nucleus, where it induces nuclear apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775970}.; PTM: Ubiquitination by XIAP/BIRC4 does not lead to proteasomal degradation.

Mainly palmitoylated at Cys-341 (PubMed:2540197, PubMed:17962520, PubMed:18547522). Palmitoylation may reduce accessibility of phosphorylation sites by anchoring the receptor to the plasma membrane. Agonist stimulation promotes depalmitoylation and further allows Ser-345 and Ser-346 phosphorylation (PubMed:11146000). Also undergoes transient, ligand-induced palmitoylation at Cys-265 probably by ZDHHC9, ZDHHC14 and ZDHHC18 within the Golgi (PubMed:27481942). Palmitoylation at Cys-265 requires phosphorylation by PKA and receptor internalization and stabilizes the receptor (PubMed:27481942).

Ser-473 phosphorylation by mTORC2 favors Thr-308 phosphorylation by PDPK1 (PubMed:21464307, PubMed:8978681). Phosphorylated at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by IKBKE and TBK1 (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18456494, PubMed:20481595, PubMed:8978681). Ser-473 phosphorylation is enhanced by interaction with AGAP2 isoform 2 (PIKE-A) (PubMed:14761976). Ser-473 phosphorylation is enhanced in focal cortical dysplasias with Taylor-type balloon cells (PubMed:17013611). Ser-473 phosphorylation is enhanced by signaling through activated FLT3 (By similarity). Ser-473 is dephosphorylated by PHLPP (PubMed:28147277). Dephosphorylated at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by PP2A phosphatase (PubMed:21329884). The phosphorylated form of PPP2R5B is required for bridging AKT1 with PP2A phosphatase (PubMed:21329884). Ser-473 is dephosphorylated by CPPED1, leading to termination of signaling (PubMed:9512493). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12149249, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14761976, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15047712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15718470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16266983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17013611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18456494, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20333297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20481595, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978158, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21329884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21464307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23799035, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28147277, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8978681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9512493, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9736715}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated via 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination by ZNRF1, leading to its degradation by the proteasome (By similarity). Ubiquitinated; undergoes both 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. TRAF6-induced 'Lys-63'-linked AKT1 ubiquitination is critical for phosphorylation and activation. When ubiquitinated, it translocates to the plasma membrane, where it becomes phosphorylated. When fully phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus, undergoes 'Lys-48'-polyubiquitination catalyzed by TTC3, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Also ubiquitinated by TRIM13 leading to its proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylated, undergoes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination preferentially at Lys-284 catalyzed by MUL1, leading to its proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19713527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20059950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21333377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22410793}.; PTM: Acetylated on Lys-14 and Lys-20 by the histone acetyltransferases EP300 and KAT2B.

Q05397	reviewed	PTK2 FAK FAK1	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation, e.g. upon integrin signaling. Tyr-397 is the major autophosphorylation site, but other kinases can also phosphorylate this residue. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 promotes interaction with SRC and SRC family members, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr-576, Tyr-577 and at additional tyrosine residues. FGR promotes phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-576. FER promotes phosphorylation at Tyr-577, Tyr-861 and Tyr-925, even when cells are not adherent. Tyr-397, Tyr-576 and Ser-722 are phosphorylated only when cells are adherent. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 is important for interaction with BMX, PIK3R1 and SHC1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-925 is important for interaction with GRB2. Dephosphorylated by PTPN11; PTPN11 is recruited to PTK2 via EPHA2 (tyrosine phosphorylated). Microtubule-induced dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 is crucial for the induction of focal adhesion disassembly; this dephosphorylation could be catalyzed by PTPN11 and regulated by ZFYVE21.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998). H2AK119Ub and ionizing radiation-induced 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub) are distinct events. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15386022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16359901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22713238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22980979, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24352239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25470042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27083998}.; PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-2 (H2AS1ph) is enhanced during mitosis.

H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15345777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15471871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16185088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16457588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17194708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17898714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18077460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18079182}.; PTM: Specifically enriched in modifications associated with active chromatin such as methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me), Lys-37 and Lys-80. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me), which are linked to gene repression, are underrepresented. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) require preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin.

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin.

Q14721	reviewed	KCNB1	PTM: Phosphorylated. Differential C-terminal phosphorylation on a subset of serines allows graded activity-dependent regulation of channel gating in hippocampal neurons. Ser-607 and Tyr-128 are significant sites of voltage-gated regulation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activities. Tyr-128 can be phosphorylated by Src and dephosphorylated by cytoplasmic form of the phosphatase PTPRE. CDK5-induced Ser-607 phosphorylation increases in response to acute blockade of neuronal activity. Phosphorylated on Tyr-128 by Src and on Ser-805 by MAPK14/P38MAPK; phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient for an increase in plasma membrane insertion, apoptotic potassium current surge and completion of the neuronal cell death program. Phosphorylated on Ser-520, Ser-607, Ser-656 and Ser-805 by CDK5; phosphorylation is necessary for KCNB1 channel clustering formation. The Ser-607 phosphorylation state differs between KCNB1-containing clusters on the proximal and distal portions of the axon initial segment (AIS). Highly phosphorylated on serine residues in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail in resting neurons. Phosphorylated in pancreatic beta cells in response to incretin hormones stimulation in a PKA- and RPS6KA5/MSK1-dependent signaling pathway, promoting beta cell survival. Phosphorylation on Ser-567 is reduced during postnatal development with low levels at P2 and P5; levels then increase to reach adult levels by P14. Phosphorylation on Ser-457, Ser-541, Ser-567, Ser-607, Ser-656 and Ser-720 as well as the N-terminal Ser-15 are sensitive to calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation contributing to the modulation of the voltage-dependent gating properties. Dephosphorylation by phosphatase PTPRE confers neuroprotection by its inhibitory influence on the neuronal apoptotic potassium current surge in a Zn(2+)-dependent manner. Dephosphorylated at Ser-607 by protein phosphatase PPP1CA. Hypoxia-, seizure- or glutamate-induced neuronal activity promote calcium/calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation resulting in a loss of KCNB1-containing clustering and enhanced channel activity. In response to brain ischemia, Ser-567 and Ser-607 are strongly dephosphorylated while Ser-457 and Ser-720 are less dephosphorylated. In response to brain seizures, phosphorylation levels on Ser-567 and Ser-607 are greatly reduced. Phosphorylated/dephosphorylated by Src or FYN tyrosine-protein kinases and tyrosine phosphatase PTPRE in primary Schwann cells and sciatic nerve tissue (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P15387, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03717}.; PTM: Acetylated.

Undergoes regulatory phosphorylation on additional residues such as Ser-246 and Ser-248 in the kinase insert domain (KID) These phosphorylations, which are probably mediated by more than one kinase, are important for binding of MAPK1/ERK2 to importin-7 (IPO7) and its nuclear translocation. In addition, autophosphorylation of Thr-190 was shown to affect the subcellular localization of MAPK1/ERK2 as well. Ligand-activated ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation. Dephosphorylated by PTPRJ at Tyr-187. Phosphorylation on Ser-29 by SGK1 results in its activation by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. DUSP3 and DUSP6 dephosphorylate specifically MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 whereas DUSP9 dephosphorylates a broader range of MAPKs.

The resulting polyubiquitination leads to protein degradation. Also ubiquitinated by SCF(BTRC) following stimulus-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20347421, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7479976}.; PTM: Deubiquitinated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Nsp2 protein, which thereby interferes with NFKBIA degradation and impairs subsequent NF-kappa-B activation.

Q5TEC6	reviewed	H3-2 HIST2H3PS2	PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation. Acetylation on Lys-10 (H3K9ac) impairs methylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s). Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). Acetylation at Lys-123 (H3K122ac) by EP300/p300 plays a central role in chromatin structure: localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) by PADI4 impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 is linked to gene activation. Symmetric dimethylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 is linked to gene repression. Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-3 (H3R2me2a) by PRMT6 is linked to gene repression and is mutually exclusive with H3 Lys-5 methylation (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me), Lys-37 (H3K36me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) are linked to gene activation. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) require preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Monomethylation at Lys-57 (H3K56me1) by EHMT2/G9A in G1 phase promotes interaction with PCNA and is required for DNA replication (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at Thr-4 (H3T3ph) by HASPIN during prophase and dephosphorylated during anaphase. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Lysine deamination at Lys-5 (H3K4all) to form allysine is mediated by LOXL2. Allysine formation by LOXL2 only takes place on H3K4me3 and results in gene repression (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Butyrylation of histones marks active promoters and competes with histone acetylation. It is present during late spermatogenesis. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Succinylation at Lys-80 (H3K79succ) by KAT2A takes place with a maximum frequency around the transcription start sites of genes. It gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. Desuccinylation at Lys-123 (H3K122succ) by SIRT7 in response to DNA damage promotes chromatin condensation and double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68431}.; PTM: Serine ADP-ribosylation constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage. Serine ADP-ribosylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ADPr) is mutually exclusive with phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and impairs acetylation at Lys-10 (H3K9ac). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68431}.

Q96J02	reviewed	ITCH	PTM: On T-cell activation, phosphorylation by the JNK cascade on serine and threonine residues surrounding the PRR domain accelerates the ubiquitination and degradation of JUN and JUNB. The increased ITCH catalytic activity due to phosphorylation by JNK1 may occur due to a conformational change disrupting the interaction between the PRR/WW motifs domain and the HECT domain and, thus exposing the HECT domain (By similarity). Phosphorylation by FYN reduces interaction with JUNB and negatively controls JUN ubiquitination and degradation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12226085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16387660, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16888620, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18718449}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated (PubMed:19116316).

Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) requires preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin.

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation.

Survival factor withdrawal induces dephosphorylation and promotes translocation to the nucleus where the dephosphorylated protein induces transcription of target genes and triggers apoptosis (PubMed:10102273). Although AKT1/PKB doesn't appear to phosphorylate Ser-315 directly, it may activate other kinases that trigger phosphorylation at this residue (PubMed:10102273, PubMed:11154281). Phosphorylated by STK4/MST1 on Ser-209 upon oxidative stress, which leads to dissociation from YWHAB/14-3-3-beta and nuclear translocation (PubMed:16751106). Phosphorylated by PIM1 (PubMed:18593906). Phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the activation of transcriptional activity without affecting subcellular localization (PubMed:17711846). In response to metabolic stress, phosphorylated by AMPK on Ser-30 which mediates FOXO3 mitochondrial translocation (PubMed:29445193). Phosphorylation by MAPKAPK5 promotes nuclear localization and DNA-binding, leading to induction of miR-34b and miR-34c expression, 2 post-transcriptional regulators of MYC that bind to the 3'UTR of MYC transcript and prevent its translation (PubMed:21329882). Phosphorylated by CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:15084260). TNF-induced inactivation of FOXO3 requires its phosphorylation at Ser-644 by IKBKB/IKKB which promotes FOXO3 retention in the cytoplasm, polyubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (PubMed:15084260). May be dephosphorylated by calcineurin A on Ser-299 which abolishes FOXO3 transcriptional activity (By similarity). In cancer cells, ERK mediated-phosphorylation of Ser-12 is required for mitochondrial translocation of FOXO3 in response to metabolic stress or chemotherapeutic agents (PubMed:29445193). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WVH4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10102273, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16751106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17711846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21329882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29445193}.; PTM: Deacetylation by SIRT1 or SIRT2 stimulates interaction of FOXO3 with SKP2 and facilitates SCF(SKP2)-mediated FOXO3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:21841822).

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998). H2AK119Ub and ionizing radiation-induced 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub) are distinct events. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15386022, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16359901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16702407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18001825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19203579, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22713238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22980979, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24352239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25470042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27083998}.; PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-2 (H2AS1ph) is enhanced during mitosis.

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation.

P16104	reviewed	H2AX H2AFX	PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-140 (to form gamma-H2AX or H2AX139ph) in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by exogenous genotoxic agents and by stalled replication forks, and may also occur during meiotic recombination events and immunoglobulin class switching in lymphocytes. Phosphorylation can extend up to several thousand nucleosomes from the actual site of the DSB and may mark the surrounding chromatin for recruitment of proteins required for DNA damage signaling and repair. Widespread phosphorylation may also serve to amplify the damage signal or aid repair of persistent lesions. Phosphorylation of Ser-140 (H2AX139ph) in response to ionizing radiation is mediated by both ATM and PRKDC while defects in DNA replication induce Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) subsequent to activation of ATR and PRKDC. Dephosphorylation of Ser-140 by PP2A is required for DNA DSB repair. In meiosis, Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may occur at synaptonemal complexes during leptotene as an ATM-dependent response to the formation of programmed DSBs by SPO11. Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may subsequently occurs at unsynapsed regions of both autosomes and the XY bivalent during zygotene, downstream of ATR and BRCA1 activation. Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may also be required for transcriptional repression of unsynapsed chromatin and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), whereby the X and Y chromosomes condense in pachytene to form the heterochromatic XY-body. During immunoglobulin class switch recombination in lymphocytes, Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may occur at sites of DNA-recombination subsequent to activation of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase AICDA. Phosphorylation at Tyr-143 (H2AXY142ph) by BAZ1B/WSTF determines the relative recruitment of either DNA repair or pro-apoptotic factors. Phosphorylation at Tyr-143 (H2AXY142ph) favors the recruitment of APBB1/FE65 and pro-apoptosis factors such as MAPK8/JNK1, triggering apoptosis. In contrast, dephosphorylation of Tyr-143 by EYA proteins (EYA1, EYA2, EYA3 or EYA4) favors the recruitment of MDC1-containing DNA repair complexes to the tail of phosphorylated Ser-140 (H2AX139ph). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10477747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10734083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10959836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11673449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12419185, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12607005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12660252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12697768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14627815, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15059890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15489221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19092802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19234442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22154951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488723}.; PTM: Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AXK119ub) by RING1 and RNF2/RING2 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression (By similarity).

Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

P04196	reviewed	HRG	PTM: Proteolytic cleavage produces several HRG fragments which are mostly disulfide-linked and, therefore, not released. Cleavage by plasmin is inhibited in the presence of heparin, zinc ions or in an acidic environment. Cleavage reduces binding of HRG to heparan sulfate, but enhances the ability of HRG to bind and tether plasminogen to the cell surface. On platelet activation, releases a 33 kDa antiangiogenic peptide which encompasses the HRR. Also cleaved in the C-terminal by plasmin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14744774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19712047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19903770}.; PTM: N-glycosylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16335952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19159218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19285951}.

Phosphorylation induces conformational changes by increasing the affinity of the N-terminus for C-terminus, resulting in inhibition of its function thus decreasing its binding to microtubules and DCTN1. Exhibits a folded, autoinhibited conformation when phosphorylated and an open conformation when dephosphorylated with increased binding affinity to microtubules and DCTN1. Phosphorylation regulates its recruitment to tyrosinated microtubules and the recruitment of vesicular cargo to microtubules in neurons (By similarity). Phosphorylation by MTOR may positively regulate CLIP1 association with microtubules (PubMed:12231510). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JK25, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231510}.

The resulting peptide form, angiotensin-A, has the same affinity for the AT1 receptor as angiotensin-2, but a higher affinity for the AT2 receptor. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17138938}.; PTM: In response to low blood pressure, the enzyme renin/REN cleaves angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin-1. Angiotensin-1 is a substrate of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) that removes a dipeptide to yield the physiologically active peptide angiotensin-2. Angiotensin-1 and angiotensin-2 can be further processed to generate angiotensin-3, angiotensin-4. Angiotensin 1-9 is cleaved from angiotensin-1 by ACE2 and can be further processed by ACE to produce angiotensin 1-7, angiotensin 1-5 and angiotensin 1-4. Angiotensin 1-7 has also been proposed to be cleaved from angiotensin-2 by ACE2 or from angiotensin-1 by MME (neprilysin). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10969042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11815627}.; PTM: The disulfide bond is labile.

Phosphorylation is essential for its proteolytic processing.; PTM: Transcriptional repressor GLI3R, a C-terminally truncated form, is generated from the full-length GLI3 protein (GLI3FL/GLI3-190) through proteolytic processing. This process requires PKA-primed phosphorylation of GLI3, ubiquitination of GLI3 and the presence of BTRC. GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. GLI3R formation leads to its dissociation from SUFU, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus, and repress Hh target genes. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and this has two consequences. First, GLI3R production is halted. Second, free GLI3FL translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Phosphorylated in vitro by ULK3. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16705181}.

The heparan sulfate chains can be cleaved either by the action of heparanase or, degraded by a deaminative process that uses nitric oxide (NO) released from the S-nitrosylated cysteines. This process is triggered by ascorbate, or by some other reducing agent, in a Cu(2+)- or Zn(2+) dependent manner.

In contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilize CRY1 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues. Ubiquitination at Lys-11 and Lys-107 are specifically ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL21) complex but not by the SCF(FBXL3) complex. Ubiquitination may be inhibited by PER2 (PubMed:17463251, PubMed:22798407, PubMed:27565346).

Q53ET0	reviewed	CRTC2 TORC2	PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation states of Ser-171 are required for regulating transduction of CREB activity (PubMed:15589160, PubMed:17210223). CRTCs/TORCs are inactive when phosphorylated, and active when dephosphorylated at this site (PubMed:17210223). This primary site of phosphorylation, is regulated by cAMP and calcium levels and is dependent on the phosphorylation of SIKs (SIK1 and SIK2) by LKB1 (PubMed:15454081, PubMed:16817901). Following adenylyl cyclase activation, dephosphorylated at Ser-171 by PPP3CA/calcineurin A resulting in CRTC2 dissociation from 14-3-3 proteins and PPP3CA (By similarity). Both insulin and AMPK increase this phosphorylation of CRTC2 while glucagon suppresses it (PubMed:15454081). Phosphorylation at Ser-274 by MARK2 is induced under low glucose conditions and dephosphorylated in response to glucose influx (PubMed:18626018). Phosphorylation at Ser-274 promotes interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and translocation to the cytoplasm (PubMed:18626018). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15454081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15589160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16817901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18626018}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation of arginine resisues by PRMT6 enhances the association of CRTC2 with CREB on the promoters of gluconeogenic genes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U182}.

Thr-186 phosphorylation requires the calcium Ca(2+) signaling pathway, including CaMK1D and calmodulin. This inhibition is relieved by Thr-29 dephosphorylation. However, phosphorylation at Thr-29 is inhibitory within the HIV transcription initiation complex. Phosphorylation at Ser-175 inhibits kinase activity. Can be phosphorylated on either Thr-362 or Thr-363 but not on both simultaneously (PubMed:18566585). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10958691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15965233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18483222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18566585, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18829461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20535204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20851342, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21448926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21533037, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21779453}.; PTM: Dephosphorylation of Thr-186 by PPM1A and PPM1B blocks CDK9 activity and may lead to CDK9 proteasomal degradation. However, PPP1CA-mediated Thr-186 dephosphorylation is required to release P-TEFb from its inactive P-TEFb/7SK snRNP complex. Dephosphorylation of C-terminus Thr and Ser residues by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) triggers CDK9 activity, contributing to the activation of HIV-1 transcription.; PTM: N6-acetylation of Lys-44 promotes kinase activity, whereas acetylation of both Lys-44 and Lys-48 mediated by PCAF/KAT2B and GCN5/KAT2A reduces kinase activity (PubMed:17452463, PubMed:18250157).

Ubiquitinated by ITCH at the cell membrane on agonist stimulation. The ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), then targets CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation. This process is dependent also on prior Ser-/Thr-phosphorylation in the C-terminal of CXCR4. Also binding of ARRB1 to STAM negatively regulates CXCR4 sorting to lysosomes though modulating ubiquitination of SFR5S. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14602072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28978524}.; PTM: Sulfation on Tyr-21 is required for efficient binding of CXCL12/SDF-1alpha and promotes its dimerization. Tyr-7 and Tyr-12 are sulfated in a sequential manner after Tyr-21 is almost fully sulfated, with the binding affinity for CXCL12/SDF-1alpha increasing with the number of sulfotyrosines present. Sulfotyrosines Tyr-7 and Tyr-12 occupy clefts on opposing CXCL12 subunits, thus bridging the CXCL12 dimer interface and promoting CXCL12 dimerization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10089882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12034737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16725153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18834145}.; PTM: O- and N-glycosylated.

Sumoylation at Lys-174 is required for inhibition of T-cells proliferation. In adipocytes, sumoylation at Lys-174 by PIAS1 leads to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Desumoylated by SENP2, which abolishes ubiquitination and stabilizes protein levels (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810706}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated, leading to proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at Thr-235 by MAPK and CDK2, serves to prime phosphorylation at Thr-226 and Ser-231 by GSK3B and acquire DNA-binding as well as transactivation activities, required to induce adipogenesis. MAPK and CDK2 act sequentially to maintain Thr-235 in the primed phosphorylated state during mitotical cloning expansion and thereby progression of terminal differentiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-266 enhances transactivation activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-325 in response to calcium increases transactivation activity. Phosphorylated at Thr-235 by RPS6KA1 (PubMed:11684016). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11684016}.; PTM: O-glycosylated, glycosylation at Ser-227 and Ser-228 prevents phosphorylation on Thr-235, Ser-231 and Thr-226 and DNA binding activity which delays the adipocyte differentiation program. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033}.; PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation at Lys-43 is an important and dynamic regulatory event that contributes to its ability to transactivate target genes, including those associated with adipogenesis and adipocyte function. Deacetylation by HDAC1 represses its transactivation activity. Acetylated by KAT2A and KAT2B within a cluster of lysine residues between amino acids 129-133, this acetylation is strongly induced by glucocorticoid treatment and enhances transactivation activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033}.

P29590	reviewed	PML MYL PP8675 RNF71 TRIM19	PTM: Ubiquitinated; mediated by RNF4, RNF111, UHRF1, UBE3A/E6AP, BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex E3 ligase complex, SIAH1 or SIAH2 and leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:18408734, PubMed:21840486, PubMed:22033920). Ubiquitination by BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex E3 ligase complex requires CDK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-518 which in turn is recognized by prolyl-isopeptidase PIN1 and PIN1-catalyzed isomerization further potentiates PML interaction with KLHL20 (PubMed:21840486, PubMed:22033920). 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by RNF4 is polysumoylation-dependent (PubMed:18408734). Ubiquitination by RNF111 is polysumoylation-dependent (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60953, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21840486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920}.; PTM: Sumoylation regulates PML's: stability in response to extracellular or intracellular stimuli, transcription directly and indirectly, through sequestration of or dissociation of the transcription factors from PML-NBs, ability to regulate apoptosis and its anti-viral activities. It is also essential for: maintaining proper PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) structure and normal function, recruitment of components of PML-NBs, the turnover and retention of PML in PML-NBs and the integrity of PML-NBs. Undergoes 'Lys-11'-linked sumoylation. Sumoylation on all three sites (Lys-65, Lys-160 and Lys-490) is required for nuclear body formation. Sumoylation on Lys-160 is a prerequisite for sumoylation on Lys-65. Lys-65 and Lys-160 are sumoylated by PISA1 and PIAS2. PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of PML promotes its interaction with CSNK2A1/CK2 and phosphorylation at Ser-565 which in turn triggers its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of PML-RARA promotes its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The PML-RARA fusion protein requires the coiled-coil domain for sumoylation. Sumoylation at Lys-490 by RANBP2 is essential for the proper assembly of PML-NBs. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 conjugated PML at Lys-160, Lys-380, Lys-400, Lys-490 and Lys-497, but Lys-380, Lys-400 and Lys-497 are not key acceptor lysines. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 forms polymeric chain on Lys-160 of PML by successive conjugation at 'Lys-18'; facilitating recruitment of PML-NB components, which enlarges PML. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 conjugation of PML increases SUMO2/3 conjugation, which leads to the recruitment of RNF4 and ubiquitin-dependent disintegration of PML-NBs. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 monoconjugated Lys-490 (PubMed:27211601). DNA damage triggers its sumoylation while some but not all viral infections can abolish sumoylation. Desumoylated by SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5 and SENP6 (PubMed:27211601, PubMed:12419228, PubMed:21148299). Arsenic induces PML and PML-RARA polysumoylation and their subsequent RNF4-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and is used as treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The nuclear isoforms (isoform PML-1, isoform PML-2, isoform PML-3, isoform PML-4, isoform PML-5 and isoform PML-6) show an increased sumoylation in response to arsenic trioxide. The cytoplasmic isoform PML-7 is not sumoylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12419228, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21148299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22155184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22406621, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27211601, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9756909}.; PTM: Phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism that controls PML protein abundance and the number and size of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, probably by ATR. HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-8, Ser-36 and Ser-38 leads to increased accumulation of PML protein and its sumoylation and is required for the maximal pro-apoptotic activity of PML after DNA damage. CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-117 is important for PML-mediated apoptosis following DNA damage. MAPK1-mediated phosphorylations at Ser-403, Ser-505, Ser-527 and Ser-530 and CDK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-518 promote PIN1-dependent PML degradation. CK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-565 primes PML ubiquitination via an unidentified ubiquitin ligase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15195100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19015637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21840486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22406621}.; PTM: Acetylation at Lys-487 is essential for its nuclear localization.
