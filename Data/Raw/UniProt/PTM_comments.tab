Q6PEY2	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.; PTM: Nitration of Tyr-450 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29146869}.; PTM: [Tubulin alpha-3E chain]: Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1 (By similarity). Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-3E chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

P21980	PTM: Disulfide bond formation inactivates the calcium-dependent acyltransferase activity (PubMed:20547769). Cys-370 can form disulfide bonds with both Cys-230 and Cys-371: formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-230 and Cys-370 facilitates formation of the disulfide between Cys-370 and Cys-371, which promotes inactivation of the acyltransferase activity (PubMed:20547769). May also form interchain disulfids between Cys-230 and Cys-370 (PubMed:25192068). Ca(2+) protects against disulfide bond formation and inactivation (PubMed:20547769). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20547769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25192068}.; PTM: Auto-transglutaminated: Forms covalent cross-links mediated by transglutaminase between Gln-633 and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue of itself or HMGB1, forming homopolymers and heteropolymers, respectively. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08587}.; PTM: S-nitrosylated, leading to inactivation of the acyltransferase activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P21981}.

Phosphorylation by NLK at these sites inhibits DNA-binding by TCF7L2/TCF4, thereby preventing transcriptional activation of target genes of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556497}.; PTM: Polysumoylated. Sumoylation is enhanced by PIAS family members and desumoylation is enhanced by SENP2. Sumoylation/desumoylation regulates TCF7L2/TCF4 transcription activity in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway without altering interaction with CTNNB1 nor binding to DNA. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12727872}.
Q12888	PTM: Asymmetrically dimethylated on Arg residues by PRMT1. Methylation is required for DNA binding. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16294045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16294047}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at basal level in the absence of DNA damage (PubMed:11042216, PubMed:11331310). Phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage: phosphorylation at different sites promotes interaction with different set of proteins: phosphorylation at the N-terminus by ATM (residues from 6-178) promotes interaction with PAXIP1 and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of dysfunctional telomeres (PubMed:23727112). Phosphorylation by ATM at residues that are located more C-terminus (residues 300-650) leads to promote interaction with RIF1 (PubMed:23727112, PubMed:23333306, PubMed:28241136). Interaction with RIF1 leads to disrupt interaction with NUDT16L1/TIRR (PubMed:28241136). Phosphorylation at Thr-1609 and Ser-1618 in the UDR motif blocks interaction with H2AK15ub (PubMed:24703952). Dephosphorylated by PPP4C (PubMed:24703952). Hyperphosphorylation during mitosis correlates with its exclusion from chromatin and DNA lesions. Hyperphosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner in response to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation (PubMed:17553757, PubMed:21144835). Dephosphorylated by PPP5C (PubMed:19176521). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11042216, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331310, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19176521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21144835, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23333306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23727112, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24703952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28241136}.

P35503	
P49767	PTM: Undergoes a complex proteolytic maturation which generates a variety of processed secreted forms with increased activity toward VEGFR-3, but only the fully processed form could activate VEGFR-2. VEGF-C first form an antiparallel homodimer linked by disulfide bonds. Before secretion, a cleavage occurs between Arg-227 and Ser-228 producing a heterotetramer. The next extracellular step of the processing removes the N-terminal propeptide. Finally the mature VEGF-C is composed mostly of two VEGF homology domains (VHDs) bound by non-covalent interactions.

P07437	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Q14511	PTM: Cell cycle-regulated processing produces four isoforms: p115, p105, p65, and p55. Isoform p115 arises from p105 phosphorylation and appears later in the cell cycle. Isoform p55 arises from p105 as a result of cleavage at a caspase cleavage-related site and it appears specifically at mitosis. The p65 isoform is poorly detected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9584194}.; PTM: PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylates the protein at the YDYVHL motif (conserved among all cas proteins). The SRC family kinases (FYN, SRC, LCK and CRK) are recruited to the phosphorylated sites and can phosphorylate other tyrosine residues. Ligation of either integrin beta-1 or B-cell antigen receptor on tonsillar B-cells and B-cell lines promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and both integrin and BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation requires an intact actin network. In fibroblasts transformation with oncogene v-ABL results in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Transiently phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking and this phosphorylated form binds to CRK and C3G. A mutant lacking the SH3 domain is phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking but not upon integrin beta-1 cross-linking. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs upon stimulation of the G-protein coupled C1a calcitonin receptor. Calcitonin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms and requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Phosphorylation at Ser-369 induces proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19539609}.

Q49AN0	PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-266 by MAPK is important for the inhibition of CLOCK-ARNTL-mediated transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by CSKNE requires interaction with PER1 or PER2. Phosphorylated in a circadian manner at Ser-554 and Ser-558 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver. Phosphorylation at Ser-558 by DYRK1A promotes subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-554 by GSK3-beta: the two-step phosphorylation at the neighboring Ser residues leads to its proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes, regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization. The SCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CRY2. In contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilize CRY2 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues. The SCF(FBXL3) complex recognizes and binds CRY2 phosphorylated at Ser-554 and Ser-558. Ubiquitination may be inhibited by PER2. Deubiquitinated by USP7 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11889036, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17463251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22798407}.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

Q9BVA1	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

A6NNZ2	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

P35916	PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Phosphorylation in response to H(2)O(2) is mediated by a process that requires SRC and PRKCD activity. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 is required for autophosphorylation at additional tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1063 and Tyr-1337 is important for interaction with CRK and subsequent activation of MAPK8. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1230, Tyr-1231 and Tyr-1337 is important for interaction with GRB2 and subsequent activation of the AKT1 and MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1 signaling pathways. In response to endothelial cell adhesion onto collagen, can also be phosphorylated in the absence of FLT4 kinase activity by SRC at Tyr-830, Tyr-833, Tyr-853, Tyr-1063, Tyr-1333, and Tyr-1337. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12881528, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15102829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15474514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16076871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20431062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23878260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700872}.

P23396	PTM: Methylation by PRMT1 is required for import into the nucleolus and for ribosome assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19460357}.; PTM: Sumoylation by SUMO1 enhances protein stability through increased resistance to proteolysis. Sumoylation occurs at one or more of the three consensus sites, Lys-18, Lys-214 and Lys-230. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21968017}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-221 by CDK1 occurs mainly in G2/M phase (PubMed:21871177). Phosphorylation by PRKCD occurs on a non-ribosomal-associated form which results in translocation of RPS3 to the nucleus and enhances its endonuclease activity (PubMed:19059439). Phosphorylated on Ser-209 by IKKB in response to activation of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex which enhances the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha and mediates the nuclear translocation of RPS3 (PubMed:21399639). Phosphorylation by MAPK is required for translocation to the nucleus following exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents such as hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17560175). Phosphorylation by PKB/AKT mediates RPS3 nuclear translocation, enhances RPS3 endonuclease activity and suppresses RPS3-induced neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:20605787). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17560175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19059439, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20605787, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21399639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21871177}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated (PubMed:16314389). This is prevented by interaction with HSP90 which stabilizes the protein (PubMed:16314389). Monoubiquitinated at Lys-214 by ZNF598 when a ribosome has stalled during translation of poly(A) sequences, leading to preclude synthesis of a long poly-lysine tail and initiate the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway to degrade the potentially detrimental aberrant nascent polypeptide (PubMed:28065601, PubMed:28132843). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28065601, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28132843}.; PTM: Ufmylated by UFL1. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P62908}.

Mainly disialylated or neutral forms of the core-2 tetrasaccharide, Galbeta1-->4GlcNAcbeta1-->6(Galbeta1-->3)GalNAcOH. The GlcN:GalN ratio is approximately 2:1 and the Man:Fuc ratio 3:5. Contains about 14% fucose with alpha-1,3 linkage present in two forms: One species is a disialylated, monofucosylated glycan, and the other, a monosialylated, trifucosylated glycan with a polylactosamine backbone. The fucosylated forms carry the Lewis antigen and are important for interaction with selectins and for functioning in leukocyte rolling. The modification containing the sialyl Lewis X glycan is on Thr-57. No sulfated O-glycans. Some N-glycosylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11081633, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12736247}.; PTM: Sulfation, in conjunction with the SLe(x)-containing glycan, is necessary for P- and L-selectin binding. High affinity P-selectin binding has a preferred requirement for the isomer sulfated on both Tyr-48 and Tyr-51, whereas L-selectin binding requires predominantly sulfation on Tyr-51 with sulfation on Tyr-48 playing only a minor role. These sulfations play an important role in L- and P-selectin-mediated neutrophil recruitment, and leukocyte rolling. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11081633}.

Q92673	PTM: Within the Golgi apparatus, the propeptide may be cleaved off by FURIN or a furin-like protease (Probable). After cleavage, the propeptide interacts with the mature protein N-terminus, preventing the association with other ligands (PubMed:11294867). At the cell surface, partially subjected to proteolytic shedding that releases the ectodomain in the extracellular milieu (PubMed:11082041, PubMed:16393139, PubMed:16531402, PubMed:28265003). The shedding may be catalyzed by ADAM17/TACE (PubMed:16393139, PubMed:16531402). Following shedding, PSEN1/presenilin-1 cleaves the remaining transmembrane fragment and catalyzes the release of a C-terminal fragment in the cytosol and of a soluble N-terminal beta fragment in the extracellular milieu.

P10636	PTM: Phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues in S-P or T-P motifs by proline-directed protein kinases (PDPK1, CDK1, CDK5, GSK3, MAPK) (only 2-3 sites per protein in interphase, seven-fold increase in mitosis, and in the form associated with paired helical filaments (PHF-tau)), and at serine residues in K-X-G-S motifs by MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK1, MARK2, MARK3 or MARK4), causing detachment from microtubules, and their disassembly (PubMed:7706316, PubMed:23666762). Phosphorylation decreases with age. Phosphorylation within tau/MAP's repeat domain or in flanking regions seems to reduce tau/MAP's interaction with, respectively, microtubules or plasma membrane components (PubMed:7706316). Phosphorylation on Ser-610, Ser-622, Ser-641 and Ser-673 in several isoforms during mitosis. Phosphorylation at Ser-548 by GSK3B reduces ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. Phosphorylation at Ser-579 by BRSK1 and BRSK2 in neurons affects ability to bind microtubules and plays a role in neuron polarization. Phosphorylated at Ser-554, Ser-579, Ser-602, Ser-606 and Ser-669 by PHK. Phosphorylation at Ser-214 by SGK1 mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. There is a reciprocal down-regulation of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. Phosphorylation on Ser-717 completely abolishes the O-GlcNAcylation on this site, while phosphorylation on Ser-713 and Ser-721 reduces glycosylation by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively. Phosphorylation on Ser-721 is reduced by about 41.5% by GlcNAcylation on Ser-717. Dephosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues by the serine/threonine phosphatase PPP5C. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14690523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14761950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15546861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19451179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21327254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21985311, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23666762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7706316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8999860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9614189}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated.

O-GlcNAcylation on Ser-717 decreases the phosphorylation on Ser-721 by about 41.5%. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14761950, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15546861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19451179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21327254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9614189}.; PTM: Glycation of PHF-tau, but not normal brain TAU/MAPT. Glycation is a non-enzymatic post-translational modification that involves a covalent linkage between a sugar and an amino group of a protein molecule forming ketoamine. Subsequent oxidation, fragmentation and/or cross-linking of ketoamine leads to the production of advanced glycation endproducts (AGES). Glycation may play a role in stabilizing PHF aggregation leading to tangle formation in AD.

P0DPH8	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen.

Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-3D chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

Q99969	PTM: Secreted in an inactive precursor form, prochemerin, which is proteolytically processed by a variety of extracellular proteases to generate forms with differing levels of bioactivity. For example, the removal of six amino acids results in chemerin-157, which exhibits the highest activity, while removal of seven amino acids results in chemerin-156 which has slightly less activity. Some proteases are able to cleave at more than one site and chemerin forms may be sequentially processed by different enzymes to modulate activity levels. The coordinated expression and activity of chemerin-modifying enzymes is essential for regulating its bioactivation, inactivation and, consequently, biological function. Cathepsin G cleaves seven C-terminal amino acids from prochemerin (chemerin-156), elastase is able to cleave six (chemerin-157), eight (chemerin-155) or eleven (chemerin-152), plasmin cleaves five amino acids (chemerin-158), and tryptase cleaves five (chemerin-158) or eight (chemerin-155). Multiple cleavages might be required to fully activate chemerin, with an initial tryptase cleavage resulting in chemerin with low activity (chemerin-158), and a second cleavage by carboxypeptidase N or B producing highly active chemerin (chemerin-157). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14675762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16096270}.

Degradation is required for termination of NF-kappa-B response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226358, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31432514}.; PTM: Monomethylated at Lys-310 by SETD6. Monomethylation at Lys-310 is recognized by the ANK repeats of EHMT1 and promotes the formation of repressed chromatin at target genes, leading to down-regulation of NF-kappa-B transcription factor activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-311 disrupts the interaction with EHMT1 without preventing monomethylation at Lys-310 and relieves the repression of target genes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-311 disrupts the interaction with EHMT1 and promotes transcription factor activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation on Ser-536 stimulates acetylation on Lys-310 and interaction with CBP; the phosphorylated and acetylated forms show enhanced transcriptional activity.

Q02447	PTM: Not glycosylated.; PTM: Acetylated by histone acetyltransferase p300, deacetylated by HDACs. Acetylation/deacetylation states regulate transcriptional activity. Acetylation appears to activate transcription. Alternate sumoylation and acetylation at Lys-551 also control transcriptional activity. Ceramides can also regulate acetylation/deacetylation events through altering the interaction of HDAC with SP3. In vitro, C(18)-ceramides, but not C(16)-ceramides, increase the interaction of HDAC1 with SP3 and enhance the deacetylation of SP3 and the subsequent repression of the TERT promoter. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11812829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12419227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12837748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15494207, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15554904, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16781829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18617891}.; PTM: Sumoylated on all isoforms.

P04350	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Phosphorylation at Thr-117 is important for interaction with IKKA and IKKB, activation of IKK and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19150425}.; PTM: Undergoes both 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. Polyubiquitinated via 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin in response to TNF signaling; this requires prior phosphorylation at Thr-117. 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination promotes TRAF2-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B.

P08047	PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues. Phosphorylation is coupled to ubiquitination, sumoylation and proteolytic processing. Phosphorylation on Ser-59 enhances proteolytic cleavage. Phosphorylation on Ser-7 enhances ubiquitination and protein degradation. Hyperphosphorylation on Ser-101 in response to DNA damage has no effect on transcriptional activity. MAPK1/MAPK3-mediated phosphorylation on Thr-453 and Thr-739 enhances VEGF transcription but, represses FGF2-triggered PDGFR-alpha transcription. Also implicated in the repression of RECK by ERBB2. Hyperphosphorylated on Thr-278 and Thr-739 during mitosis by MAPK8 shielding SP1 from degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Phosphorylated in the zinc-finger domain by calmodulin-activated PKCzeta. Phosphorylation on Ser-641 by PKCzeta is critical for TSA-activated LHR gene expression through release of its repressor, p107. Phosphorylation on Thr-668, Ser-670 and Thr-681 is stimulated by angiotensin II via the AT1 receptor inducing increased binding to the PDGF-D promoter. This phosphorylation is increased in injured artey wall. Ser-59 and Thr-681 can both be dephosphorylated by PP2A during cell-cycle interphase. Dephosphorylation on Ser-59 leads to increased chromatin association during interphase and increases the transcriptional activity. On insulin stimulation, sequentially glycosylated and phosphorylated on several C-terminal serine and threonine residues. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11904305, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14593115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16332679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16377629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16943418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17049555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18171990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18199680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18258854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18619531}.; PTM: Acetylated.

Deacetylation leads to an increase in the expression the 12(s)-lipooxygenase gene though recruitment of p300 to the promoter. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16478997}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination occurs on the C-terminal proteolytically-cleaved peptide and is triggered by phosphorylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18239466}.; PTM: Sumoylated with SUMO1. Sumoylation modulates proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal repressor domain. Sumoylation levels are attenuated during tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation mediates SP1 desumoylation.; PTM: Proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal repressor domain is prevented by sumoylation. The C-terminal cleaved product is susceptible to degradation.; PTM: O-glycosylated; Contains 8 N-acetylglucosamine side chains. Levels are controlled by insulin and the SP1 phosphorylation states. Insulin-mediated O-glycosylation locates SP1 to the nucleus, where it is sequentially deglycosylated and phosphorylated. O-glycosylation affects transcriptional activity through disrupting the interaction with a number of transcription factors including ELF1 and NFYA. Also inhibits interaction with the HIV1 promoter. Inhibited by peroxisomome proliferator receptor gamma (PPARgamma).

Phosphorylation at Tyr-211 by EGFR stabilizes chromatin-associated PCNA. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17115032}.; PTM: Acetylated by CREBBP and p300/EP300; preferentially acetylated by CREBBP on Lys-80, Lys-13 and Lys-14 and on Lys-77 by p300/EP300 upon loading on chromatin in response to UV irradiation (PubMed:24939902, PubMed:19419956). Lysine acetylation disrupts association with chromatin, hence promoting PCNA ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in response to UV damage in a CREBBP- and EP300-dependent manner (PubMed:24939902). Acetylation disrupts interaction with NUDT15 and promotes degradation (PubMed:19419956). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated (PubMed:24939902, PubMed:20227374). Following DNA damage, can be either monoubiquitinated to stimulate direct bypass of DNA lesions by specialized DNA polymerases or polyubiquitinated to promote recombination-dependent DNA synthesis across DNA lesions by template switching mechanisms. Following induction of replication stress, monoubiquitinated by the UBE2B-RAD18 complex on Lys-164, leading to recruit translesion (TLS) polymerases, which are able to synthesize across DNA lesions in a potentially error-prone manner. An error-free pathway also exists and requires non-canonical polyubiquitination on Lys-164 through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 complex UBE2N-UBE2V2 and the E3 ligases, HLTF, RNF8 and SHPRH. This error-free pathway, also known as template switching, employs recombination mechanisms to synthesize across the lesion, using as a template the undamaged, newly synthesized strand of the sister chromatid. Monoubiquitination at Lys-164 also takes place in undamaged proliferating cells, and is mediated by the DCX(DTL) complex, leading to enhance PCNA-dependent translesion DNA synthesis. Sumoylated during S phase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15149598, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17130289, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18316726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18719106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18948756, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20129063, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20227374, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22153967, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24939902}.; PTM: Methylated on glutamate residues by ARMT1/C6orf211. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25732820}.

P29590	PTM: Ubiquitinated; mediated by RNF4, RNF111, UHRF1, UBE3A/E6AP, BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex E3 ligase complex, SIAH1 or SIAH2 and leading to subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:18408734, PubMed:21840486, PubMed:22033920). Ubiquitination by BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex E3 ligase complex requires CDK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-518 which in turn is recognized by prolyl-isopeptidase PIN1 and PIN1-catalyzed isomerization further potentiates PML interaction with KLHL20 (PubMed:21840486, PubMed:22033920). 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by RNF4 is polysumoylation-dependent (PubMed:18408734). Ubiquitination by RNF111 is polysumoylation-dependent (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60953, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21840486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920}.; PTM: Sumoylation regulates PML's: stability in response to extracellular or intracellular stimuli, transcription directly and indirectly, through sequestration of or dissociation of the transcription factors from PML-NBs, ability to regulate apoptosis and its anti-viral activities. It is also essential for: maintaining proper PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) structure and normal function, recruitment of components of PML-NBs, the turnover and retention of PML in PML-NBs and the integrity of PML-NBs. Undergoes 'Lys-11'-linked sumoylation. Sumoylation on all three sites (Lys-65, Lys-160 and Lys-490) is required for nuclear body formation. Sumoylation on Lys-160 is a prerequisite for sumoylation on Lys-65. Lys-65 and Lys-160 are sumoylated by PISA1 and PIAS2. PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of PML promotes its interaction with CSNK2A1/CK2 and phosphorylation at Ser-565 which in turn triggers its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of PML-RARA promotes its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The PML-RARA fusion protein requires the coiled-coil domain for sumoylation. Sumoylation at Lys-490 by RANBP2 is essential for the proper assembly of PML-NBs. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 conjugated PML at Lys-160, Lys-380, Lys-400, Lys-490 and Lys-497, but Lys-380, Lys-400 and Lys-497 are not key acceptor lysines. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 forms polymeric chain on Lys-160 of PML by successive conjugation at 'Lys-18'; facilitating recruitment of PML-NB components, which enlarges PML. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 conjugation of PML increases SUMO2/3 conjugation, which leads to the recruitment of RNF4 and ubiquitin-dependent disintegration of PML-NBs. SUMO1P1/SUMO5 monoconjugated Lys-490 (PubMed:27211601). DNA damage triggers its sumoylation while some but not all viral infections can abolish sumoylation. Desumoylated by SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5 and SENP6 (PubMed:27211601, PubMed:12419228, PubMed:21148299). Arsenic induces PML and PML-RARA polysumoylation and their subsequent RNF4-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and is used as treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The nuclear isoforms (isoform PML-1, isoform PML-2, isoform PML-3, isoform PML-4, isoform PML-5 and isoform PML-6) show an increased sumoylation in response to arsenic trioxide.

Phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, probably by ATR. HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-8, Ser-36 and Ser-38 leads to increased accumulation of PML protein and its sumoylation and is required for the maximal pro-apoptotic activity of PML after DNA damage. CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-117 is important for PML-mediated apoptosis following DNA damage. MAPK1-mediated phosphorylations at Ser-403, Ser-505, Ser-527 and Ser-530 and CDK1/2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-518 promote PIN1-dependent PML degradation. CK2-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-565 primes PML ubiquitination via an unidentified ubiquitin ligase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12402044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15195100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408734, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19015637, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21840486, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22033920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22406621}.; PTM: Acetylation at Lys-487 is essential for its nuclear localization.

Q5TEC6	PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation. Acetylation on Lys-10 (H3K9ac) impairs methylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s). Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). Acetylation at Lys-123 (H3K122ac) by EP300/p300 plays a central role in chromatin structure: localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) by PADI4 impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 is linked to gene activation. Symmetric dimethylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 is linked to gene repression.

Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) require preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Monomethylation at Lys-57 (H3K56me1) by EHMT2/G9A in G1 phase promotes interaction with PCNA and is required for DNA replication (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at Thr-4 (H3T3ph) by HASPIN during prophase and dephosphorylated during anaphase. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Lysine deamination at Lys-5 (H3K4all) to form allysine is mediated by LOXL2.

It is present during late spermatogenesis. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Succinylation at Lys-80 (H3K79succ) by KAT2A takes place with a maximum frequency around the transcription start sites of genes. It gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. Desuccinylation at Lys-123 (H3K122succ) by SIRT7 in response to DNA damage promotes chromatin condensation and double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68431}.; PTM: Serine ADP-ribosylation constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage. Serine ADP-ribosylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ADPr) is mutually exclusive with phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and impairs acetylation at Lys-10 (H3K9ac). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68431}.

P06401	PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple serine sites. Several of these sites are hormone-dependent. Phosphorylation on Ser-294 occurs preferentially on isoform B, is highly hormone-dependent and modulates ubiquitination and sumoylation on Lys-388. Phosphorylation on Ser-102 and Ser-345 also requires induction by hormone. Basal phosphorylation on Ser-81, Ser-162, Ser-190 and Ser-400 is increased in response to progesterone and can be phosphorylated in vitro by the CDK2-A1 complex. Increased levels of phosphorylation on Ser-400 also in the presence of EGF, heregulin, IGF, PMA and FBS. Phosphorylation at this site by CDK2 is ligand-independent, and increases nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-162 and Ser-294, but not at Ser-190, is impaired during the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. Phosphorylation on Ser-345 by ERK1/2 MAPK is required for interaction with SP1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10628747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10655479, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11110801, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15572662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15798179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17020914, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17173941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17347654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17717077, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18202149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7476977, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8702648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9171245}.; PTM: Sumoylation is hormone-dependent and represses transcriptional activity.

Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Phosphorylation at Tyr-579, and to a lesser degree, at Tyr-581, is important for interaction with SRC family kinases. Phosphorylation at Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 is important for interaction with PIK3R1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-751 is important for interaction with NCK1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-771 and Tyr-857 is important for interaction with RASA1/GAP.

It also affects deubiquitination by deubiquitinase enzymes such as USP30 (PubMed:25527291). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24660806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24751536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24784582, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25527291}.; PTM: [Ubiquitin]: Mono-ADP-ribosylated at the C-terminus by PARP9, a component of the PPAR9-DTX3L complex. ADP-ribosylation requires processing by E1 and E2 enzymes and prevents ubiquitin conjugation to substrates such as histones. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28525742}.

Q9NY65	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.

Phosphorylation at Ser-247 by CSNK1D/CK1 represses kinase activity and impairs ARNT binding. Phosphorylation by GSK3-beta and PLK3 promote degradation by the proteasome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20699359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20889502}.; PTM: Sumoylated; with SUMO1 under hypoxia. Sumoylation is enhanced through interaction with RWDD3. Both sumoylation and desumoylation seem to be involved in the regulation of its stability during hypoxia. Sumoylation can promote either its stabilization or its VHL-dependent degradation by promoting hydroxyproline-independent HIF1A-VHL complex binding, thus leading to HIF1A ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Desumoylation by SENP1 increases its stability amd transcriptional activity. There is a disaccord between various publications on the effect of sumoylation and desumoylation on its stability and transcriptional activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15465032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15776016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17610843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17956732}.; PTM: Acetylation of Lys-532 by ARD1 increases interaction with VHL and stimulates subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:12464182). Deacetylation of Lys-709 by SIRT2 increases its interaction with and hydroxylation by EGLN1 thereby inactivating HIF1A activity by inducing its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:24681946). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12464182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24681946}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated; in normoxia, following hydroxylation and interaction with VHL. Lys-532 appears to be the principal site of ubiquitination. Clioquinol, the Cu/Zn-chelator, inhibits ubiquitination through preventing hydroxylation at Asn-803.

EGLN3/PHD3 has also been shown to hydroxylate Pro-564 (PubMed:11292861, PubMed:11566883, PubMed:12351678, PubMed:15776016, PubMed:25974097). The hydroxylated prolines promote interaction with VHL, initiating rapid ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:11292861, PubMed:11566883, PubMed:12351678, PubMed:15776016, PubMed:25974097). Deubiquitinated by USP20 (PubMed:11292861, PubMed:11566883, PubMed:12351678, PubMed:15776016, PubMed:25974097). Under hypoxia, proline hydroxylation is impaired and ubiquitination is attenuated, resulting in stabilization (PubMed:11292861, PubMed:11566883, PubMed:12351678, PubMed:15776016, PubMed:25974097). In normoxia, is hydroxylated on Asn-803 by HIF1AN, thus abrogating interaction with CREBBP and EP300 and preventing transcriptional activation (PubMed:12080085). This hydroxylation is inhibited by the Cu/Zn-chelator, Clioquinol (PubMed:12080085). Repressed by iron ion, via Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes-mediated hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:28296633). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11292861, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11566883, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12080085, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12351678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15776016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25974097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28296633}.; PTM: The iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent 3-hydroxylation of asparagine is (S) stereospecific within HIF CTAD domains.

P15941	PTM: Highly glycosylated (N- and O-linked carbohydrates and sialic acid). O-glycosylated to a varying degree on serine and threonine residues within each tandem repeat, ranging from mono- to penta-glycosylation. The average density ranges from about 50% in human milk to over 90% in T47D breast cancer cells. Further sialylation occurs during recycling. Membrane-shed glycoproteins from kidney and breast cancer cells have preferentially sialyated core 1 structures, while secreted forms from the same tissues display mainly core 2 structures. The O-glycosylated content is overlapping in both these tissues with terminal fucose and galactose, 2- and 3-linked galactose, 3- and 3,6-linked GalNAc-ol and 4-linked GlcNAc predominating. Differentially O-glycosylated in breast carcinomas with 3,4-linked GlcNAc. N-glycosylation consists of high-mannose, acidic complex-type and hybrid glycans in the secreted form MUC1/SEC, and neutral complex-type in the transmembrane form, MUC1/TM. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10373415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7744025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9312074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9597769}.; PTM: Proteolytic cleavage in the SEA domain occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum by an autoproteolytic mechanism and requires the full-length SEA domain as well as requiring a Ser, Thr or Cys residue at the P + 1 site. Cleavage at this site also occurs on isoform MUC1/X but not on isoform MUC1/Y. Ectodomain shedding is mediated by ADAM17. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11341784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12441351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987679}.; PTM: Dual palmitoylation on cysteine residues in the CQC motif is required for recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16507569}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosines and serine residues in the C-terminal. Phosphorylation on tyrosines in the C-terminal increases the nuclear location of MUC1 and beta-catenin. Phosphorylation by PKC delta induces binding of MUC1 to beta-catenin/CTNNB1 and thus decreases the formation of the beta-catenin/E-cadherin complex. Src-mediated phosphorylation inhibits interaction with GSK3B. Src- and EGFR-mediated phosphorylation on Tyr-1229 increases binding to beta-catenin/CTNNB1. GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation on Ser-1227 decreases this interaction but restores the formation of the beta-cadherin/E-cadherin complex. On T-cell receptor activation, phosphorylated by LCK. PDGFR-mediated phosphorylation increases nuclear colocalization of MUC1CT and CTNNB1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11152665, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11483589, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12750561, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14521915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15513966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16288032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17545600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7664271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7988707, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9819408}.; PTM: The N-terminal sequence has been shown to begin at position 24 or 28. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11341784}.

Phosphorylation by AKT1 is required for the repressor activity but has no effect on DNA binding, protein stability nor subcellular localization. Phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. This phosphorylation on Ser-219 and Ser-369 is critical for ligand binding, nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in response to FSH signaling. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16417524, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20215566}.; PTM: Sumoylated with SUMO2, mainly on Lys-399 which is also required for SENP6 binding. On all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) binding, a confromational change may occur that allows sumoylation on two additional site, Lys-166 and Lys-171. Probably desumoylated by SENP6.

Dephosphorylation also promotes MT-bundling activity by allowing dimerization. Phosphorylation by CDK1 prevents PLK1-binding: upon degradation of CDK1 at anaphase and dephosphorylation, it is then phosphorylated by PLK1, leading to cytokinesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17351640, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17438553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9885575}.

Q13563	PTM: Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation is important for protein function; a mutant that lacks the N-terminal phosphorylation sites cannot complement a zebrafish pkd2-deficient mutant (PubMed:16551655). PKD-mediated phosphorylation at the C-terminus regulates its function in the release of Ca(2+) stores from the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20881056). PKA-mediated phosphorylation at a C-terminal site strongly increases the open probability of the channel, but does not increase single channel conductance (PubMed:26269590). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16551655, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20881056, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26269590}.; PTM: N-glycosylated. The four subunits in a tetramer probably differ in the extent of glycosylation; simultaneous glycosylation of all experimentally validated sites would probably create steric hindrance. Thus, glycosylation at Asn-305 is not compatible with glycosylation at Asn-328; only one of these two residues is glycosylated at a given time. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28092368}.

P04049	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-269, Ser-338, Tyr-341, Thr-491 and Ser-494 results in its activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-29, Ser-43, Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301 and Ser-642 by MAPK1/ERK2 results in its inactivation. Phosphorylation at Ser-259 induces the interaction with YWHAZ and inactivates kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of Ser-259 by the complex containing protein phosphatase 1, SHOC2 and M-Ras/MRAS relieves inactivation, leading to stimulate RAF1 activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-338 by PAK1 and PAK5 and Ser-339 by PAK1 is required for its mitochondrial localization. Phosphorylation at Ser-621 in response to growth factor treatment stabilizes the protein, possibly by preventing proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation at Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301, Ser-338 and Ser-621 are somehow linked to the methylation potential of cells. Treatment of cells with HGF in the presence of the methylation inhibitor 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) results in increased phosphorylation at Ser-338 and Ser-621 and decreased phosphorylation at Ser-296, Ser-301 and Ser-338. Dephosphorylation at Ser-338 by PPP5C results in an activity decrease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10801873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447113, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11733498, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11756411, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15047712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16093354, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16630891, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18465753, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21917714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7477354, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8349614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9823899}.; PTM: Methylated at Arg-563 in response to EGF treatment.

Q9Y572	PTM: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). Autophosphorylated following interaction with ZBP1 (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Ser-199 plays a role in the necroptotic function of RIPK3 (PubMed:11734559, PubMed:19524512). Autophosphorylates at Ser-227 following activation by ZBP1: phosphorylation at these sites is a hallmark of necroptosis and is required for binding MLKL (PubMed:22265413). Phosphorylation at Thr-182 is important for its kinase activity, interaction with PELI1 and PELI1-mediated 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and for its ability to mediate TNF-induced necroptosis (PubMed:29883609). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9QZL0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11734559, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524512, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265413, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29883609}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated with 'Lys-48' and 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2, leading to activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21931591).

P84022	PTM: Phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Enhanced phosphorylation in the linker region on Thr-179, Ser-204 and Ser-208 on EGF and TGF-beta treatment. Ser-208 is the main site of MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. CDK-mediated phosphorylation occurs in a cell-cycle dependent manner and inhibits both the transcriptional activity and antiproliferative functions of SMAD3. This phosphorylation is inhibited by flavopiridol. Maximum phosphorylation at the G(1)/S junction. Also phosphorylated on serine residues in the C-terminal SXS motif by TGFBR1 and ACVR1. TGFBR1-mediated phosphorylation at these C-terminal sites is required for interaction with SMAD4, nuclear location and transactivational activity, and appears to be a prerequisite for the TGF-beta mediated phosphorylation in the linker region. Dephosphorylated in the C-terminal SXS motif by PPM1A. This dephosphorylation disrupts the interaction with SMAD4, promotes nuclear export and terminates TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Phosphorylation at Ser-418 by CSNK1G2/CK1 promotes ligand-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, thus inhibiting SMAD3-mediated TGF-beta responses. Phosphorylated by PDPK1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11224571, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15241418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15588252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16156666, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19218245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21947082, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8774881, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9843571}.; PTM: Acetylation in the nucleus by EP300 in the MH2 domain regulates positively its transcriptional activity and is enhanced by TGF-beta. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16862174}.; PTM: Poly-ADP-ribosylated by PARP1 and PARP2.

Phosphorylation on Ser-178 and Thr-507 creates binding sites for YWHAE/14-3-3 epsilon which inhibits CDC25A. Phosphorylation on Ser-76, Ser-124, Ser-178, Ser-279 and Ser-293 may also promote ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of CDC25A by the SCF complex. Phosphorylation of CDC25A at Ser-76 by CHEK1 primes it for subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-79, Ser-82 and Ser-88 by NEK11. Phosphorylation by NEK11 is required for BTRC-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation by PIM1 leads to an increase in phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated by PLK3 following DNA damage, leading to promote its ubiquitination and degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11298456, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12399544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12759351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14559997, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14681206, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19734889, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20090422, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20228808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21376736}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase complex that contains FZR1/CDH1 during G1 phase leading to its degradation by the proteasome.

O15530	PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-241 in the activation loop is required for full activity. PDPK1 itself can autophosphorylate Ser-241, leading to its own activation. Autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2 (By similarity). Tyr-9 phosphorylation is critical for stabilization of both PDPK1 and the PDPK1/SRC complex via HSP90-mediated protection of PDPK1 degradation. Angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDPK1 in vascular smooth muscle in a calcium- and SRC-dependent manner. Phosphorylated on Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. Palmitate negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Ser-241 and palmitate-induced phosphorylation at Ser-529 and Ser-501 by PKC/PRKCQ negatively regulates its ability to phosphorylate PKB/AKT1. Phosphorylation at Thr-354 by MELK partially inhibits kinase activity, the inhibition is cooperatively enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-394 and Ser-398 by MAP3K5. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10455013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11481331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15743829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16780920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22544756, ECO:0000269|Ref.8}.; PTM: Autophosphorylated; autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated in the kinase domain, deubiquitinated by USP4.

P68371	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Methylglyoxal, a reactive metabolite that accumulates when the glycolytic enzyme PGK1 is inhibited, promotes formation of a methylimidazole cross-link between proximal Cys-151 and Arg-135 on another KEAP1 molecule, resulting in an inactive dimer that inactivates the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:30323285). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z2X8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17127771, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18251510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29590092, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30323285}.; PTM: Degraded via a proteasomal-independent process during selective autophagy: interaction with phosphorylated SQSTM1/p62 sequesters KEAP1 in inclusion bodies, leading to its degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15983046, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20452972}.; PTM: Auto-ubiquitinated by the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:15572695, PubMed:15983046).

In the nucleoplasm, ubiquitination is counteracted by USP28, which interacts with isoform 1 of FBXW7 (FBW7alpha), leading to its deubiquitination and preventing degradation. In the nucleolus, however, ubiquitination is not counteracted by USP28 but by USP36, due to the lack of interaction between isoform 3 of FBXW7 (FBW7gamma) and USP28, explaining the selective MYC degradation in the nucleolus (PubMed:25775507,PubMed:17558397).

Phosphorylated by CDK2 at Ser-125 and Thr-199. Phosphorylation at Thr-199 may trigger initiation of centrosome duplication. Phosphorylated by CDK1 at Thr-199, Thr-219, Thr-234 and Thr-237 during cell mitosis. When these four sites are phosphorated, RNA-binding activity seem to be abolished. May be phosphorylated at Ser-70 by NEK2. The Thr-199 phosphorylated form has higher affinity for ROCK2.

P30307	PTM: Phosphorylated by CHEK1 and MAPK14 at Ser-216. This phosphorylation creates a binding site for 14-3-3 protein and inhibits the phosphatase. Phosphorylated by PLK4. Phosphorylated by PLK1, leading to activate the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation by PLK3 at Ser-191 promotes nuclear translocation. Ser-198 is a minor phosphorylation site. Was initially reported to be phosphorylated by PLK3 at Ser-216 (PubMed:10557092). However, such phosphorylation by PLK3 was not confirmed by other groups. Phosphorylation at Thr-48, Thr-67, Ser-122, Thr-130, Ser-168 and Ser-214 occurs at G2 and G2-M transition and is probably catalyzed by CDK1. Ser-168 phosphorylation levels are lower than those at the other 5 CDK1 sites.

P28300	PTM: The lysine tyrosylquinone cross-link (LTQ) is generated by condensation of the epsilon-amino group of a lysine with a topaquinone produced by oxidation of tyrosine. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P33072}.; PTM: Proteolytically cleaved by BMP1 which removes the propeptide (PubMed:31152061). Also proteolytically cleaved by ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14, but not by ADAMTS3, at an additional cleavage site downstream of the BMP1 cleavage site (PubMed:31152061). The propeptide plays a role in directing the deposition of this enzyme to elastic fibers, via interaction with tropoelastin (By similarity). Cleavage by BMP1 to remove the propeptide does not increase enzymatic activity but increases binding to collagen (PubMed:31152061). Cleavage by ADAMTS2 produces a form with reduced collagen-binding activity (PubMed:31152061). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31152061}.; PTM: Sulfated at Tyr-187 and also at either Tyr-183 or Tyr-184 which enhances binding to collagen. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31152061}.

O60331	PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-650 negatively regulates binding to TLN2 and is strongly stimulated in mitosis. Phosphorylation on Tyr-649 is necessary for targeting to focal adhesions. Phosphorylation on Ser-650 and Tyr-649 are mutually exclusive. Phosphorylated by SYK and CSK (By similarity). Tyrosine phosphorylation is enhanced by PTK2 signaling. Phosphorylated at Tyr-639 upon EGF stimulation. Some studies suggest that phosphorylation on Tyr-649 enhances binding to tailins (TLN1 and TLN2). According to PubMed:15738269 phosphorylation at Tyr-649 does not directly enhance binding to tailins (TLN1 and TLN2) but may act indirectly by inhibiting phosphorylation at Ser-650. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15738269}.; PTM: Acetylation at Lys-265 and Lys-268 seems to decrease lipid 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity.

O14974	PTM: Phosphorylated by CIT (Rho-associated kinase) (By similarity). Phosphorylated cooperatively by ROCK1 and CDC42BP on Thr-696. Phosphorylated on upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1.

Q9H0H5	PTM: Phosphorylated at multiple sites in the midbody during cytokinesis (PubMed:12689593). Phosphorylation by AURKB on Ser-387 at the midbody is, at least in part, responsible for exerting its latent GAP activity towards RhoA (PubMed:12689593). Phosphorylation on multiple serine residues by PLK1 enhances its association with ECT2 and is critical for cleavage furrow formation (PubMed:19468302, PubMed:19468300). Phosphorylation on Ser-164 plays a major role in mediating interaction with ECT2 (PubMed:25068414). Phosphorylation on Ser-157 does not appear to contribute to binding to ECT2 (PubMed:25068414). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12689593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19468300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19468302, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25068414}.

P12931	PTM: Myristoylated at Gly-2, and this is essential for targeting to membranes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7525268}.; PTM: Dephosphorylated at Tyr-530 by PTPRJ (By similarity). Phosphorylated on Tyr-530 by c-Src kinase (CSK). The phosphorylated form is termed pp60c-src. Dephosphorylated by PTPRJ at Tyr-419. Normally maintained in an inactive conformation with the SH2 domain engaged with Tyr-530, the SH3 domain engaged with the SH2-kinase linker, and Tyr-419 dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 as a result of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) action disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and Tyr-530, Tyr-419 can then become autophosphorylated, resulting in SRC activation. Phosphorylation of Tyr-530 by CSK allows this interaction to reform, resulting in SRC inactivation. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-75 targets SRC to ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. Phosphorylated by PTK2/FAK1; this enhances kinase activity. Phosphorylated by PTK2B/PYK2; this enhances kinase activity. Upon activation of IL6ST by IL6, Tyr-419 is phosphorylated and Tyr-530 dephosphorylated (PubMed:25731159). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14661060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18936167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21442427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22888118, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25731159, ECO:0000269|PubMed:6273838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7525268}.; PTM: S-nitrosylation is important for activation of its kinase activity. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated in response to CDK5-mediated phosphorylation.

Q07955	PTM: Phosphorylated by CLK1, CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4. Phosphorylated by SRPK1 at multiple serines in its RS domain via a directional (C-terminal to N-terminal) and a dual-track mechanism incorporating both processive phosphorylation (in which the kinase stays attached to the substrate after each round of phosphorylation) and distributive phosphorylation steps (in which the kinase and substrate dissociate after each phosphorylation event). The RS domain of SRSF1 binds to a docking groove in the large lobe of the kinase domain of SRPK1 and this induces certain structural changes in SRPK1 and/or RRM 2 domain of SRSF1, allowing RRM 2 to bind the kinase and initiate phosphorylation. The cycles continue for several phosphorylation steps in a processive manner (steps 1-8) until the last few phosphorylation steps (approximately steps 9-12). During that time, a mechanical stress induces the unfolding of the beta-4 motif in RRM 2, which then docks at the docking groove of SRPK1. This also signals RRM 2 to begin to dissociate, which facilitates SRSF1 dissociation after phosphorylation is completed. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14555757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18155240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18687337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19477182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19886675}.; PTM: Asymmetrically dimethylated at arginines, probably by PRMT1, methylation promotes localization to nuclear speckles. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20308322}.

P68366	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen.

Q07352	PTM: Phosphorylated (PubMed:19179481). Phosphorylated by RPS6KA1 at Ser-334 upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment; this phosphorylation results in dissociation of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and induces p38 MAPK-mediated stabilization of the low-density lipoprotein receptor LDLR mRNA (PubMed:25106868). Phosphorylated by protein kinase AKT1 at Ser-92 and Ser-203 in response to insulin; these phosphorylations stabilize ZFP36L1, increase the association with 14-3-3 proteins and mediate ARE-containing mRNA stabilization (PubMed:15538381, PubMed:17030608).

Q13509	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Q3ZCM7	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase. This phosphorylation inhibits tubulin incorporation into microtubules. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16371510}.

Q71U36	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.; PTM: Nitration of Tyr-451 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10339593}.; PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26968983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29146869}.; PTM: [Tubulin alpha-1A chain]: Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1. Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003, PubMed:26968983). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (PubMed:26968983). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26968983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-1A chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

Q6ZV29	
P53350	PTM: Catalytic activity is enhanced by phosphorylation of Thr-210. Phosphorylation at Thr-210 is first detected on centrosomes in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, peaks in prometaphase and gradually disappears from centrosomes during anaphase. Dephosphorylation at Thr-210 at centrosomes is probably mediated by protein phosphatase 1C (PP1C), via interaction with PPP1R12A/MYPT1. Autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Ser-137 may not be significant for the activation of PLK1 during mitosis, but may enhance catalytic activity during recovery after DNA damage checkpoint. Phosphorylated in vitro by STK10. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12207013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12442251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12639966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18477460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18615013}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in anaphase and following DNA damage, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Ubiquitination is mediated via its interaction with FZR1/CDH1. Ubiquitination and subsequent degradation prevents entry into mitosis and is essential to maintain an efficient G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Monoubiquitination at Lys-492 by the BCR(KLHL22) ubiquitin ligase complex does not lead to degradation: it promotes PLK1 dissociation from phosphoreceptor proteins and subsequent removal from kinetochores, allowing silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and chromosome segregation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18662541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23455478}.

Q9H0J4	
P60484	PTM: Constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 under normal conditions. Phosphorylated in vitro by MAST1, MAST2, MAST3 and STK11. Phosphorylation results in an inhibited activity towards PIP3. Phosphorylation can both inhibit or promote PDZ-binding. Phosphorylation at Tyr-336 by FRK/PTK5 protects this protein from ubiquitin-mediated degradation probably by inhibiting its binding to NEDD4. Phosphorylation by ROCK1 is essential for its stability and activity. Phosphorylation by PLK3 promotes its stability and prevents its degradation by the proteasome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10646847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11035045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11707428, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12297295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15951562, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18716620, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19345329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20940307}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated; monoubiquitination is increased in presence of retinoic acid.

It appears to prolong the lifetime of the GTP state of RAB1B by restricting access of GTPase effectors to switch 2 and blocking effector-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, thereby rendering RAB1B constitutively active. It is later de-AMPylated by L.pneumophila SidD, releasing RAB1B from bacterial phagosomes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20651120}.; PTM: Phosphocholinated at Ser-76 by L.pneumophila AnkX, leading to displace GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDI).

P48023	PTM: The soluble form derives from the membrane form by proteolytic processing. The membrane-bound form undergoes two successive intramembrane proteolytic cleavages. The first one is processed by ADAM10 producing an N-terminal fragment, which lacks the receptor-binding extracellular domain.

Mainly phosphorylated at Ser-23 and Ser-29, by cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDK1, respectively during DNA replication and mitosis. Dephosphorylation may require the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4. Phosphorylation at Ser-23 and Ser-29 is a prerequisite for further phosphorylation. Becomes hyperphosphorylated on additional residues including Ser-4, Ser-8, Thr-21 and Ser-33 in response to DNA damage. Hyperphosphorylation is mediated by ATM, ATR and PRKDC. Primarily recruited to DNA repair nuclear foci as a hypophosphorylated form it undergoes subsequent hyperphosphorylation, catalyzed by ATR. Hyperphosphorylation is required for RAD51 recruitment to chromatin and efficient DNA repair. Phosphorylation at Thr-21 depends upon RFWD3 presence. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12814551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1318195, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20154705, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21558276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21731742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26474068, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8246944, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9139719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9295339}.; PTM: DNA damage-induced 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by PRPF19 mediates ATRIP recruitment to the RPA complex at sites of DNA damage and activation of ATR (PubMed:24332808).

P24928	PTM: The tandem heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) can be highly phosphorylated (PubMed:28076779). The phosphorylation activates Pol II. Phosphorylation occurs mainly at residues 'Ser-2' and 'Ser-5' of the heptapeptide repeat and is mediated, at least, by CDK7 and CDK9. CDK7 phosphorylation of POLR2A associated with DNA promotes transcription initiation by triggering dissociation from DNA. Phosphorylation also takes place at 'Ser-7' of the heptapeptide repeat, which is required for efficient transcription of snRNA genes and processing of the transcripts. The phosphorylation state is believed to result from the balanced action of site-specific CTD kinases and phosphatases, and a 'CTD code' that specifies the position of Pol II within the transcription cycle has been proposed. Dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase CTDSP1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17157258, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17234882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19136461, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19450536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19667075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21127351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22137580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28076779}.; PTM: Among tandem heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) some do not match the Y-S-P-T-S-P-S consensus, the seventh serine residue 'Ser-7' being replaced by a lysine. 'Lys-7' in these non-consensus heptapeptide repeats can be alternatively acetylated, methylated and dimethylated. EP300 is one of the enzyme able to acetylate 'Lys-7'. Acetylation at 'Lys-7' of non-consensus heptapeptide repeats is associated with 'Ser-2' phosphorylation and active transcription. Regulates initiation or early elongation steps of transcription specially for inducible genes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24207025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26687004}.; PTM: Methylated at Arg-1810 prior to transcription initiation when the CTD is hypophosphorylated, phosphorylation at Ser-1805 and Ser-1808 preventing this methylation. Symmetrically or asymmetrically dimethylated at Arg-1810 by PRMT5 and CARM1 respectively. Symmetric or asymmetric dimethylation modulates interactions with CTD-binding proteins like SMN1/SMN2 and TDRD3. SMN1/SMN2 interacts preferentially with the symmetrically dimethylated form while TDRD3 interacts with the asymmetric form. Through the recruitment of SMN1/SMN2, symmetric dimethylation is required for resolving RNA-DNA hybrids created by RNA polymerase II, that form R-loop in transcription terminal regions, an important step in proper transcription termination. CTD dimethylation may also facilitate the expression of select RNAs. Among tandem heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (CTD) some do not match the Y-S-P-T-S-P-S consensus, the seventh serine residue 'Ser-7' being replaced by a lysine. 'Lys-7' in these non-consensus heptapeptide repeats can be alternatively acetylated, methylated, dimethylated and trimethylated. Methylation occurs in the earliest transcription stages and precedes or is concomitant to 'Ser-5' and 'Ser-7' phosphorylation. Dimethylation and trimehtylation at 'Lys-7' of non-consensus heptapeptide repeats are exclusively associated with phosphorylated CTD. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P08775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26566685, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26687004, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26700805}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by WWP2 leading to proteasomal degradation (By similarity).

Q9BXM7	PTM: Proteolytically cleaved (PubMed:19229105, PubMed:22354088, PubMed:30733118). In healthy cells, the precursor is continuously imported into the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), where it is proteolytically cleaved by mitochondrial-processing peptidase (MPP) and then undergoes further proteolytic cleavage by PARL or AFG3L2 to give rise to the 52 kDa short form (PubMed:19229105, PubMed:22354088). The 52 kDa short form is then released into the cytosol where it rapidly undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation (PubMed:20404107). In unhealthy cells, when cellular stress conditions lead to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial import is impaired leading to the precursor accumulating on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (PubMed:20404107, PubMed:30733118). If accumulation at the OMM fails and it is imported into the depolarized mitochondria, it undergoes cleavage by the IMM protease OMA1, promoting its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:30733118). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19229105, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20404107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22354088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30733118}.; PTM: Autophosphorylated (PubMed:20404107, PubMed:22910362, PubMed:18957282).

Q9BUF5	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-172 by CDK1 during the cell cycle, from metaphase to telophase, but not in interphase.

Cleavage is crucial for limiting TNF-induced apoptosis, necroptosis and inflammatory response (PubMed:31827281, PubMed:31827280). Cleavage abolishes NF-kappa-B activation and enhances the interaction of TRADD with FADD (PubMed:10521396). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521396, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827280, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827281}.; PTM: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:18408713, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:31827280). Phosphorylation of Ser-161 by RIPK3 is necessary for the formation of the necroptosis-inducing complex (PubMed:18408713). Phosphorylation at Ser-25 represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (PubMed:30988283). Phosphorylated at Ser-320 by MAP3K7 which requires prior ubiquitination with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2 (By similarity). This phosphorylation positively regulates RIPK1 interaction with RIPK3 to promote necroptosis but negatively regulates RIPK1 kinase activity and its interaction with FADD to mediate apoptosis (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18408713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19524513, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30988283, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31827280}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-48'-, 'Lys-63'- and linear-linked type ubiquitin (PubMed:15258597, PubMed:16603398, PubMed:18450452, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21931591, PubMed:29883609, Ref.33). Polyubiquitination with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by TRAF2 induces association with the IKK complex (PubMed:15258597). Deubiquitination of 'Lys-63'-linked chains and polyubiquitination with 'Lys-48'-linked chains by TNFAIP3 leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently down-regulates TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:15258597). 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination by RFFL or RNF34 also promotes proteasomal degradation and negatively regulates TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:18450452, Ref.33). Linear polyubiquitinated; the head-to-tail linear polyubiquitination ('Met-1'-linked) is mediated by the LUBAC complex and decreases protein kinase activity (PubMed:21455173). Deubiquitination of linear polyubiquitin by CYLD promotes the kinase activity (By similarity). Polyubiquitinated with 'Lys-48' and 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2, leading to activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21931591). Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by PELI1 (PubMed:29883609). Ubiquitination at Lys-377 with 'Lys-63'-linked chains by BIRC2/c-IAP1 and BIRC3/c-IAP2 is essential for its phosphorylation at Ser-320 mediated by MAP3K7 (By similarity). This ubiquitination is required for NF-kB activation, suppresses RIPK1 kinase activity and plays a critical role in preventing cell death during embryonic development (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15258597, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16603398, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18450452, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21455173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21931591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29883609, ECO:0000269|Ref.33}.

Q15465	PTM: [Sonic hedgehog protein]: The C-terminal domain displays an autoproteolysis activity and a cholesterol transferase activity (By similarity). Both activities result in the cleavage of the full-length protein and covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated N-terminal fragment (ShhN) (By similarity). Cholesterylation is required for the sonic hedgehog protein N-product targeting to lipid rafts and multimerization (PubMed:24522195, PubMed:26875496). ShhN is the active species in both local and long-range signaling, whereas the C-product (ShhC) is degraded in the reticulum endoplasmic (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q62226, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26875496, ECO:0000305|PubMed:24522195}.; PTM: [Sonic hedgehog protein N-product]: N-palmitoylation by HHAT of ShhN is required for sonic hedgehog protein N-product multimerization and full activity (By similarity).

Q9H853	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group. Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.

In contrast, no proteolytically cleavage is detected in S.Typhi-infected cells (PubMed:22042847). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22042847}.

O95863	PTM: Phosphorylated by GSK3B. Once phosphorylated, it becomes a target for BTRC ubiquitination. Phosphorylation by CSNK1E, probably at Ser-104, provides the priming site for the subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B, probably at Ser-100 and Ser-96. Phosphorylation by PAK1 may modulate its transcriptional activity by promoting increased accumulation in the nucleus. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 and Ser-92 positively regulates its functions in induction of EMT and cell survival, respectively. Phosphorylation by LATS2, upon mitotic stress, oncogenic stress or Hippo pathway activation, occurs in the nucleus and promotes nuclear retention and stabilization of total cellular protein level. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15647282, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19923321, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20305697, ECO:0000305|PubMed:15448698}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated on Lys-98, Lys-137 and Lys-146 by FBXL14 and BTRC leading to degradation. BTRC-triggered ubiquitination requires previous GSK3B-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation. Ubiquitination induced upon interaction with NOTCH1 or TP53/p53 is mediated by MDM2.; PTM: O-GlcNAcylation at Ser-112 is enhanced in hyperglycaemic conditions, it opposes phosphorylation by GSK3B, and stabilizes the protein.; PTM: ADP-ribosylation by PARP1 increases protein half-life and may be involved in TGFB-induced SNAI1 up-regulation.

Q9BQE3	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24906155}.; PTM: Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68363}.; PTM: Nitration of Tyr-449 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36}.; PTM: Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29146869}.; PTM: [Tubulin alpha-1C chain]: Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1 (By similarity). Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules (PubMed:26972003). In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68369, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q71U36, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26972003}.; PTM: [Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-1C chain]: Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (PubMed:25908662). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68373, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

P40967	PTM: A small amount of P1/P100 (major form) undergoes glycosylation to yield P2/P120 (minor form). P2 is cleaved by a furin-like proprotein convertase (PC) in a pH-dependent manner in a post-Golgi, prelysosomal compartment into two disulfide-linked subunits: a large lumenal subunit, M-alpha/ME20-S, and an integral membrane subunit, M-beta. Despite cleavage, only a small fraction of M-alpha is secreted, whereas most M-alpha and M-beta remain associated with each other intracellularly. M-alpha is further processed to M-alpha N and M-alpha C. M-alpha C further undergoes processing to yield M-alpha C1 and M-alpha C3 (M-alpha C2 in the case of PMEL17-is or PMEL17-ls). Formation of intralumenal fibrils in the melanosomes requires the formation of M-alpha that becomes incorporated into the fibrils. Stage II melanosomes harbor only Golgi-modified Pmel17 fragments that are derived from M-alpha and that bear sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11694580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15096515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15695812, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17991747}.; PTM: N-glycosylated.

At low cholesterol the SCAP-SREBP complex is recruited into COPII vesicles for export from the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:8626610, PubMed:32322062, PubMed:9651382, PubMed:10805775). In the Golgi, complex SREBPs are cleaved sequentially by site-1 (MBTPS1, S1P) and site-2 (MBTPS2, S2P) protease (PubMed:8626610, PubMed:9651382, PubMed:10805775, PubMed:32322062). The first cleavage by site-1 protease occurs within the luminal loop, the second cleavage by site-2 protease occurs within the first transmembrane domain, releasing the transcription factor from the Golgi membrane (PubMed:9651382, PubMed:10805775). Apoptosis triggers cleavage by the cysteine proteases caspase-3 and caspase-7. Cleavage and activation is induced by mediated cholesterol efflux (PubMed:8643593). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10805775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8626610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8643593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9651382}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by AMPK, leading to suppress protein processing and nuclear translocation, and repress target gene expression. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U1N2}.; PTM: [Processed sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2]: Ubiquitinated; the nuclear form has a rapid turnover and is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome in the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11477106}.

Q9Y237	PTM: Phosphorylated. Isoform 1 phosphorylation occurs both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Isoform 1 phosphorylation at Ser-19 does not affect its PPIase activity but is required for nuclear localization, and the dephosphorylation is a prerequisite for the binding to DNA. The unphosphorylated isoform 1 associates with the pre-rRNP complexes in the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12860119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19369196}.; PTM: Isoform 2 is sumoylated with SUMO2 and SUMO3. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16522211}.

Q9HBF5	
P42224	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues in response to a variety of cytokines/growth hormones including IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, PDGF and EGF. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Upon EGF stimulation, phosphorylation on Tyr-701 (lacking in beta form) by JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2 promotes dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Growth hormone (GH) activates STAT1 signaling only via JAK2. Tyrosine phosphorylated in response to constitutively activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 by several kinases including MAPK14, ERK1/2 and CAMKII on IFN-gamma stimulation, regulates STAT1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 promotes sumoylation though increasing interaction with PIAS. Phosphorylation on Ser-727 by PRKCD induces apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging agents. Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when PTK2/FAK1 is activated; most likely this is catalyzed by a SRC family kinase. Dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues by PTPN2 negatively regulates interferon-mediated signaling. Upon viral infection or IFN induction, phosphorylation on Ser-708 occurs much later than phosphorylation on Tyr-701 and is required for the binding of ISGF3 on the ISREs of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes IKBKE-dependent. Phosphorylation at Tyr-701 and Ser-708 are mutually exclusive, phosphorylation at Ser-708 requires previous dephosphorylation of Tyr-701. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15322115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17561467, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17897103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19088846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21135090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22065572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28753426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7543024, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7657660}.; PTM: Sumoylated with SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3.

However, the role of ADP-ribosylation in the prevention of phosphorylation has been called into question and the lack of phosphorylation may be due to sumoylation of Lys-703 (PubMed:29858569). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27796300, ECO:0000305|PubMed:29858569}.; PTM: Monomethylated at Lys-525 by SETD2; monomethylation is necessary for phosphorylation at Tyr-701, translocation into the nucleus and activation of the antiviral defense. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28753426}.; PTM: (Microbial infection) Ubiquitinated by Herpes simplex virus 2 E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP22. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:32699158}.

Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 are DNA damage-inducible phosphorylation sites (inducible with ionizing radiation, IR) dephosphorylated by PPP5C. Autophosphorylation induces a conformational change that leads to remodeling of the DNA-PK complex, requisite for efficient end processing and DNA repair. Autophosphorylation of the T2609 cluster is required for hematopoietic development and protein synthesis in erythrocytes precursors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97313, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10026262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10467406, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11889123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12186630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231622, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509254, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14612514, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14627815, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14704337, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14734805, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1597196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16046194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16397295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2247066, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2507541, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8407951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8464713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8804412, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9139719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9362500, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9363941}.; PTM: S-nitrosylated by GAPDH. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated by RNF144A, leading to proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24979766}.

Phosphorylation at Tyr-308 by PDGFRA inhibits binding to GTF2I (PubMed:18829532, PubMed:19393245). Phosphorylated by PRKCA at Ser-1221 and Thr-1226, induces relocalization from the cytoplasm to regions of plasma membrane ruffling and prevents the binding and substrate specificity regulation by phospholipids (PubMed:19673492). In brain, phosphorylated by FYN and SRC (By similarity). During focal adhesion formation, phosphorylated by MAPK1 and MAPK3 at the C-terminal region, probably at Ser-1451, Ser-1476, Thr-1480 and Ser-1483. Phosphorylation by MAPK1 and MAPK3 inhibits GAP function and localizes ARGHAP35 away from newly forming focal adhesions and stress fibers in cells spreading on fibronectin (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-1476 and Thr-1480 by GSK3B requires priming by MAPK and inhibits RhoGAP activity and modulates polarized cell migration (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P81128, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q91YM2, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18829532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19393245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19673492}.

P50552	PTM: Major substrate for cAMP-dependent (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in platelets. The preferred site for PKA is Ser-157, the preferred site for PKG/PRKG1, Ser-239. In ADP-activated platelets, phosphorylation by PKA or PKG on Ser-157 leads to fibrinogen receptor inhibition. Phosphorylation on Thr-278 requires prior phosphorylation on Ser-157 and Ser-239. In response to phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation, phosphorylated by PKC/PRKCA. In response to thrombin, phosphorylated by both PKC and ROCK1. Phosphorylation at Thr-278 by AMPK does not require prior phosphorylation at Ser-157 or Ser-239. Phosphorylation at Ser-157 by PKA is required for localization to the tight junctions in epithelial cells. Phosphorylation modulates F-actin binding, actin filament elongation and platelet activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-322 by AMPK also alters actin filament binding.

P68363	PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (PubMed:26875866). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (PubMed:26875866). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26875866}.; PTM: Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are monoglycylated but not polyglycylated due to the absence of functional TTLL10 in human. Monoglycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella). Both polyglutamylation and monoglycylation can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering glycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. The precise function of monoglycylation is still unclear (Probable). {ECO:0000305|PubMed:19524510}.; PTM: Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen.

Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P05213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25908662}.

Phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2 at Ser-60 and Ser-186; phosphorylation increases its stability and cytoplasmic localization, promotes binding to 14-3-3 adapter proteins and inhibits the recruitment of cytoplasmic CCR4-NOT and PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase complexes to the mRNA decay machinery, thereby inhibiting ZFP36-induced ARE-containing mRNA deadenylation and decay processes. Phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2 does not impair ARE-containing RNA-binding.

ISGylation negatively regulates its function in antiviral signaling response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16009940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18057259, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20368735}.; PTM: Sumoylated, probably by MUL1; inhibiting its polyubiquitination. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20368735, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23399697}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. 'Lys-63' ubiquitination by RNF135, which occurs after RNA-binding and homodimerization, releases the autoinhibition of the CARD domains by the RLR CTR domain, an essential step in the activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway (PubMed:23950712, PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). Lys-172 is the critical site of ubiquitination for MAVS/IPS1 binding and to induce anti-viral signal transduction (PubMed:17392790, PubMed:30193849). Lys-154, Lys-164 and Lys-172 are shared sites for RNF135-mediated and TRIM4-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19017631, PubMed:19484123, PubMed:24755855). Also undergoes 'Lys-48' ubiquitination at Lys-181 by RNF125 that leads to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17460044, PubMed:26471729). 'Lys-48' ubiquitination follows viral infection and is enhanced by 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of the CARD domains that promotes interaction with VCP/p97 and subsequent recruitment of RNF125 (PubMed:17460044, PubMed:26471729). Within a negative feedback loop involving SIGLEC10 and PTPN11, 'Lys-48' ubiquitination at Lys-812 by CBL also elicits the proteasomal degradation of DDX58 (By similarity). Deubiquitinated by CYLD, a protease that selectively cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains (PubMed:18636086). Also probably deubiquitinated by USP17L2/USP17 that cleaves 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains and positively regulates the receptor (PubMed:20368735). Ubiquitinated by TRIM40 via 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination; leading to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:29117565). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6Q899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17392790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17460044, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18636086, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19017631, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19484123, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20368735, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23950712, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24755855, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26471729, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29117565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30193849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31006531}.

S-nitrosylation of Cys-247 is induced by interferon-gamma and LDL(ox) implicating the iNOS-S100A8/9 transnitrosylase complex and seems to prevent interaction with phosphorylated RPL13A and to interfere with GAIT complex activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22771119, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25417112}.; PTM: ISGylated. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:16815975}.; PTM: Sulfhydration at Cys-152 increases catalytic activity. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Oxidative stress can promote the formation of high molecular weight disulfide-linked GAPDH aggregates, through a process called nucleocytoplasmic coagulation. Such aggregates can be observed in vivo in the affected tissues of patients with Alzheimer disease or alcoholic liver cirrhosis, or in cell cultures during necrosis. Oxidation at Met-46 may play a pivotal role in the formation of these insoluble structures. This modification has been detected in vitro following treatment with free radical donor (+/-)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexenamide. It has been proposed to destabilize nearby residues, increasing the likelihood of secondary oxidative damages, including oxidation of Tyr-45 and Met-105. This cascade of oxidations may augment GAPDH misfolding, leading to intermolecular disulfide cross-linking and aggregation. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:25086035}.; PTM: Succination of Cys-152 and Cys-247 by the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, which leads to S-(2-succinyl)cysteine residues, inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Fumarate concentration as well as succination of cysteine residues in GAPDH is significantly increased in muscle of diabetic mammals. It was proposed that the S-(2-succinyl)cysteine chemical modification may be a useful biomarker of mitochondrial and oxidative stress in diabetes and that succination of GAPDH and other thiol proteins by fumarate may contribute to the metabolic changes underlying the development of diabetes complications. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P04797}.

Q05397	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation, e.g. upon integrin signaling. Tyr-397 is the major autophosphorylation site, but other kinases can also phosphorylate this residue. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 promotes interaction with SRC and SRC family members, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr-576, Tyr-577 and at additional tyrosine residues. FGR promotes phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-576. FER promotes phosphorylation at Tyr-577, Tyr-861 and Tyr-925, even when cells are not adherent. Tyr-397, Tyr-576 and Ser-722 are phosphorylated only when cells are adherent. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 is important for interaction with BMX, PIK3R1 and SHC1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-925 is important for interaction with GRB2. Dephosphorylated by PTPN11; PTPN11 is recruited to PTK2 via EPHA2 (tyrosine phosphorylated). Microtubule-induced dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 is crucial for the induction of focal adhesion disassembly; this dephosphorylation could be catalyzed by PTPN11 and regulated by ZFYVE21. Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues is enhanced by NTN1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P34152, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12387730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15561106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17395594, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17431114, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18006843, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19339212, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21454698}.; PTM: Sumoylated; this enhances autophosphorylation. {ECO:0000250}.

P46527	PTM: Phosphorylated; phosphorylation occurs on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation on Ser-10 is the major site of phosphorylation in resting cells, takes place at the G(0)-G(1) phase and leads to protein stability. Phosphorylation on other sites is greatly enhanced by mitogens, growth factors, cMYC and in certain cancer cell lines. The phosphorylated form found in the cytoplasm is inactivate. Phosphorylation on Thr-198 is required for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation on Thr-187, by CDK1 and CDK2 leads to protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Tyrosine phosphorylation promotes this process. Phosphorylation by PKB/AKT1 can be suppressed by LY294002, an inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of PI3K.

Q15848	PTM: HMW complexes are more extensively glycosylated than smaller oligomers. Hydroxylation and glycosylation of the lysine residues within the collagen-like domain of adiponectin seem to be critically involved in regulating the formation and/or secretion of HMW complexes and consequently contribute to the insulin-sensitizing activity of adiponectin in hepatocytes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60994}.; PTM: O-glycosylated. Not N-glycosylated. O-linked glycans on hydroxylysines consist of Glc-Gal disaccharides bound to the oxygen atom of post-translationally added hydroxyl groups. Sialylated to varying degrees depending on tissue. Thr-22 appears to be the major site of sialylation. Higher sialylation found in SGBS adipocytes than in HEK fibroblasts. Sialylation is not required neither for heterodimerization nor for secretion. Not sialylated on the glycosylated hydroxylysines. Desialylated forms are rapidly cleared from the circulation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497731, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19855092}.; PTM: Succination of Cys-36 by the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, which leads to S-(2-succinyl)cysteine residues, inhibits polymerization and secretion of adiponectin. Adiponectin is a major target for succination in both adipocytes and adipose tissue of diabetic mammals. It was proposed that succination of proteins is a biomarker of mitochondrial stress and accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates in adipose tissue in diabetes and that succination of adiponectin may contribute to the decrease in plasma adiponectin in diabetes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q60994}.

Ubiquitination appears to occur GPCR-specific. Ubiquitinated by MDM2; the ubiquitination is required for rapid internalization of ADRB2. Deubiquitinated by USP33; the deubiquitination leads to a dissociation of the beta-arrestin-GPCR complex. Stimulation of a class A GPCR, such as ADRB2, induces transient ubiquitination and subsequently promotes association with USP33. Stimulation of a class B GPCR promotes a sustained ubiquitination. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19363159}.; PTM: Hydroxylation by PHD2 modulates the rate of internalization by slowing down recruitment to the plasma membrane and inhibiting subsequent co-internalization with class A receptors. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21255264}.

P11802	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-172 is required for enzymatic activity. Phosphorylated, in vitro, at this site by CCNH-CDK7, but, in vivo, appears to be phosphorylated by a proline-directed kinase. In the cyclin D-CDK4-CDKN1B complex, this phosphorylation and consequent CDK4 enzyme activity, is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of CDKN1B. Thus, in proliferating cells, CDK4 within the complex is phosphorylated on Thr-172 in the T-loop. In resting cells, phosphorylation on Thr-172 is prevented by the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of CDKN1B. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16782892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19075005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19237555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19237565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19487459}.

Q12778	PTM: Phosphorylation by NLK promotes nuclear export and inhibits the transcriptional activity. In response to growth factors, phosphorylation on Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-322 by PKB/AKT1 promotes nuclear export and inactivation of transactivational activity. Phosphorylation on Thr-24 is required for binding 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser-256 decreases DNA-binding activity and promotes the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319, permitting phosphorylation of Ser-322 and Ser-325, probably by CDK1, leading to nuclear exclusion and loss of function. Stress signals, such as response to oxygen or nitric oxide, attenuate the PKB/AKT1-mediated phosphorylation leading to nuclear retention. Phosphorylation of Ser-329 is independent of IGF1 and leads to reduced function. Dephosphorylated on Thr-24 and Ser-256 by PP2A in beta-cells under oxidative stress leading to nuclear retention (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Ser-249 by CDK1 disrupts binding of 14-3-3 proteins leading to nuclear accumulation and has no effect on DNA-binding nor transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by STK4/MST1 on Ser-212, upon oxidative stress, inhibits binding to 14-3-3 proteins and nuclear export. PPIA/CYPA promotes its dephosphorylation on Ser-256 (PubMed:31063815). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R1E0, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11311120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11980723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18356527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18786403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19221179, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21245099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31063815}.; PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation at Lys-262, Lys-265 and Lys-274 are necessary for autophagic cell death induction. Deacetylated by SIRT2 in response to oxidative stress or serum deprivation, thereby negatively regulating FOXO1-mediated autophagic cell death. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20543840}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by SKP2. Ubiquitination leads to proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15668399}.; PTM: Methylation inhibits AKT1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-256 and is increased by oxidative stress. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: Once in the nucleus, acetylated by CREBBP/EP300. Acetylation diminishes the interaction with target DNA and attenuates the transcriptional activity. It increases the phosphorylation at Ser-256. Deacetylation by SIRT1 results in reactivation of the transcriptional activity. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide treatment appears to promote deacetylation and uncoupling of insulin-induced phosphorylation. By contrast, resveratrol acts independently of acetylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11237865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11980723}.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

P06493	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-161 by CAK/CDK7 activates kinase activity. Phosphorylation at Thr-14 and Tyr-15 by PKMYT1 prevents nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE1 and WEE2 inhibits the protein kinase activity and acts as a negative regulator of entry into mitosis (G2 to M transition). Phosphorylation by PKMYT1 and WEE1 takes place during mitosis to keep CDK1-cyclin-B complexes inactive until the end of G2. By the end of G2, PKMYT1 and WEE1 are inactivated, but CDC25A and CDC25B are activated. Dephosphorylation by active CDC25A and CDC25B at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, leads to CDK1 activation at the G2-M transition. Phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by WEE2 during oogenesis is required to maintain meiotic arrest in oocytes during the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, a long period of quiescence at dictyate prophase I, leading to prevent meiotic reentry. Phosphorylation by WEE2 is also required for metaphase II exit during egg activation to ensure exit from meiosis in oocytes and promote pronuclear formation. Phosphorylated at Tyr-4 by PKR/EIF2AK2 upon genotoxic stress. This phosphorylation triggers CDK1 polyubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis, thus leading to G2 arrest. In response to UV irradiation, phosphorylation at Tyr-15 by PRKCD activates the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19917613, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20360007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3289755, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7569953}.; PTM: Polyubiquitinated upon genotoxic stress. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20395957}.
Q9H211	PTM: Two independent E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, SCF(SKP2) and the DCX(DTL) complex, mediated CDT1 degradation in S phase. Ubiquitinated by the DCX(DTL) complex, in response to DNA damage, leading to its degradation. Ubiquitination by the DCX(DTL) complex is necessary to ensure proper cell cycle regulation and is PCNA-dependent: interacts with PCNA via its PIP-box, while the presence of the containing the 'K+4' motif in the PIP box, recruit the DCX(DTL) complex, leading to its degradation.

Q53ET0	PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation states of Ser-171 are required for regulating transduction of CREB activity (PubMed:15589160, PubMed:17210223). CRTCs/TORCs are inactive when phosphorylated, and active when dephosphorylated at this site (PubMed:17210223). This primary site of phosphorylation, is regulated by cAMP and calcium levels and is dependent on the phosphorylation of SIKs (SIK1 and SIK2) by LKB1 (PubMed:15454081, PubMed:16817901). Following adenylyl cyclase activation, dephosphorylated at Ser-171 by PPP3CA/calcineurin A resulting in CRTC2 dissociation from 14-3-3 proteins and PPP3CA (By similarity). Both insulin and AMPK increase this phosphorylation of CRTC2 while glucagon suppresses it (PubMed:15454081). Phosphorylation at Ser-274 by MARK2 is induced under low glucose conditions and dephosphorylated in response to glucose influx (PubMed:18626018). Phosphorylation at Ser-274 promotes interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and translocation to the cytoplasm (PubMed:18626018). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U182, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15454081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15589160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16817901, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18626018}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation of arginine resisues by PRMT6 enhances the association of CRTC2 with CREB on the promoters of gluconeogenic genes. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q3U182}.

Q16526	PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-247 by MAPK is important for the inhibition of CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by CSNK1E requires interaction with PER1 or PER2. Phosphorylation at Ser-71 and Ser-280 by AMPK decreases protein stability. Phosphorylation at Ser-568 exhibits a robust circadian rhythm with a peak at CT8, increases protein stability, prevents SCF(FBXL3)-mediated degradation and is antagonized by interaction with PRKDC. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes, regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization. The SCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CRY1. In contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads to stabilize CRY1 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex. The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues. Ubiquitination at Lys-11 and Lys-107 are specifically ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL21) complex but not by the SCF(FBXL3) complex. Ubiquitination may be inhibited by PER2 (PubMed:17463251, PubMed:22798407, PubMed:27565346). Deubiquitinated by USP7 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17463251, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22798407, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27565346}.; PTM: Undergoes autophagy-mediated degradation in the liver in a time-dependent manner.

Phosphorylation at Thr-847 by CDK1 is essential for the recruitment to DNA and the DNA repair function. Phosphorylated on Ser-327 as cells enter G2 phase. This phosphorylation is required for binding BRCA1 and for the G2/M DNA damage transition checkpoint control. Phosphorylation at Thr-315, probably catalyzed by CDK2, is required for PIN1-binding, while phosphorylation at Ser-276 serves as a PIN1 isomerization site. Phosphorylation at Thr-315 is cell-cycle dependent. It steadily increases during S phase, peaks at late S/G2 phase, and drops at G1 (PubMed:23623683). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10910365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15485915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17965729, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19202191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23623683}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated (PubMed:14654780, PubMed:16818604, PubMed:27561354).

Ubiquitinated by RNF138 at its N-terminus (PubMed:26502057). Ubiquitinated through 'Lys-48' by the E3 CUL3-KLHL15 complex; this modification leads to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:27561354).

Q9Y2T6	
P29317	PTM: Autophosphorylates. Phosphorylated on tyrosine upon binding and activation by EFNA1. Phosphorylated residues Tyr-588 and Tyr-594 are required for binding VAV2 and VAV3 while phosphorylated residues Tyr-735 and Tyr-930 are required for binding PI3-kinase p85 subunit (PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3). These phosphorylated residues are critical for recruitment of VAV2 and VAV3 and PI3-kinase p85 subunit which transduce downstream signaling to activate RAC1 GTPase and cell migration. Dephosphorylation of Tyr-930 by PTPRF prevents the interaction of EPHA2 with NCK1. Phosphorylated at Ser-897 by PKB; serum-induced phosphorylation which targets EPHA2 to the cell leading edge and stimulates cell migration. Phosphorylation by PKB is inhibited by EFNA1-activated EPHA2 which regulates PKB activity via a reciprocal regulatory loop. Phosphorylated at Ser-897 in response to TNF by RPS6KA1 and RPS6KA3; RPS6KA-EPHA2 signaling pathway controls cell migration (PubMed:26158630). Phosphorylated at Ser-897 by PKA; blocks cell retraction induced by EPHA2 kinase activity (PubMed:27385333). Dephosphorylated by ACP1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10655584, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18794797, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19573808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23358419, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26158630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27385333}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated by CHIP/STUB1.

Deacetylated at Lys-26 by SIRT1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15469825}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-54 (H1R54ci) by PADI4 takes place within the DNA-binding site of H1 and results in its displacement from chromatin and global chromatin decondensation, thereby promoting pluripotency and stem cell maintenance. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P43274}.; PTM: ADP-ribosylated on Ser-150 in response to DNA damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27723750}.
Q6NXT2	PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation. Acetylation on Lys-10 (H3K9ac) impairs methylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s). Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). Acetylation at Lys-122 (H3K122ac) by EP300/p300 plays a central role in chromatin structure: localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) by PADI4 impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 is linked to gene activation. Symmetric dimethylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 is linked to gene repression. Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-3 (H3R2me2a) by PRMT6 is linked to gene repression and is mutually exclusive with H3 Lys-5 methylation (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) is linked to gene activation. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) requires preliminary monoubiquitination of H2B at 'Lys-120'. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Monomethylation at Lys-56 (H3K56me1) by EHMT2/G9A in G1 phase promotes interaction with PCNA and is required for DNA replication (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Phosphorylated at Thr-4 (H3T3ph) by HASPIN during prophase and dephosphorylated during anaphase. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Tyr-41 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Lysine deamination at Lys-5 (H3K4all) to form allysine is mediated by LOXL2. Allysine formation by LOXL2 only takes place on H3K4me3 and results in gene repression (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Butyrylation of histones marks active promoters and competes with histone acetylation. It is present during late spermatogenesis. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68433}.; PTM: Succinylated. Desuccinylation at Lys-122 (H3K122succ) by SIRT7 in response to DNA damage promotes chromatin condensation and double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Serine ADP-ribosylation constitutes the primary form of ADP-ribosylation of proteins in response to DNA damage. Serine ADP-ribosylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ADPr) is mutually exclusive with phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and impairs acetylation at Lys-10 (H3K9ac). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P68431}.

Q14289	PTM: Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to various stimuli that elevate the intracellular calcium concentration; this activation is indirect and may be mediated by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Tyr-402 is the major autophosphorylation site, but other kinases can also phosphorylate Tyr-402. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Phosphorylation at Tyr-402 promotes interaction with SRC and SRC family members, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr-579; Tyr-580 and Tyr-881. Phosphorylation at Tyr-881 is important for interaction with GRB2. Phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation of FGR and PKC. Recruitment by NPHP1 to cell matrix adhesions initiates Tyr-402 phosphorylation. In monocytes, adherence to substrata is required for tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation. Angiotensin II, thapsigargin and L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) also induce autophosphorylation and increase kinase activity. Phosphorylation by MYLK promotes ITGB2 activation and is thus essential to trigger neutrophil transmigration during lung injury. Dephosphorylated by PTPN12. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11493697, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15166227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17329398, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18587400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19207108, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20028775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20381867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20521079, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9545257}.

In muscle, glycosylation on Thr-317, Thr-319 and Thr-379 by a phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycan with the structure 2-(N-acetylamido)-2-deoxygalactosyl-beta-1,3-2-(N-acetylamido)-2-deoxyglucosyl-beta-1,4-6-phosphomannose is mediated by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE1) protein and is required for laminin binding (PubMed:20044576, PubMed:21987822, PubMed:24256719). The O-glycosyl hexose on Thr-367, Thr-369, Thr-372, Thr-381 and Thr-388 is probably mannose. O-glycosylated in the N-terminal region with a core 1 or possibly core 8 glycan. The brain form displays a unique glycosylation pattern which is absent in other tissues; this form shows enhanced binding to laminin LAMA5 compared to the skeletal muscle form (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O18738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12140558, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16254364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360738, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17905726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19838169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20044576, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20507882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21987822, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23234360, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24256719, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27493216}.; PTM: [Alpha-dystroglycan]: (Microbial infection) O-mannosylation is required for binding lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Old World Lassa fever virus, and clade C New World arenaviruses. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16254364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17360738}.; PTM: [Beta-dystroglycan]: N-glycosylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18764929}.; PTM: Autolytic cleavage produces the alpha and beta subunits.

P68431	PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation. Acetylation on Lys-10 (H3K9ac) impairs methylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s). Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). Acetylation at Lys-123 (H3K122ac) by EP300/p300 plays a central role in chromatin structure: localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11242053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15345777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15471871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16185088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16457588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17194708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19520870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23415232}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) by PADI4 impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15345777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15471871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16567635}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) by CARM1 is linked to gene activation. Symmetric dimethylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s) by PRMT5 is linked to gene repression. Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-3 (H3R2me2a) by PRMT6 is linked to gene repression and is mutually exclusive with H3 Lys-5 methylation (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15345777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15471871, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16457588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17194708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17898714, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18077460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18079182}.; PTM: Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me), Lys-37 (H3K36me) and Lys-80 (H3K79me) are linked to gene activation. Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-80 (H3K79me) is associated with DNA double-strand break (DSB) responses and is a specific target for TP53BP1. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me) are linked to gene repression. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) and acetylation of H3 and H4.

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) is also an essential regulatory mechanism for neoplastic cell transformation. Phosphorylated at Ser-29 (H3S28ph) by MAP3K20 isoform 1, RPS6KA5 or AURKB during mitosis or upon ultraviolet B irradiation. Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) by PRKCB is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase, by DAPK3 and PKN1. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by PKN1 is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me) by KDM4C/JMJD2C. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) by chromatin-associated CHEK1 regulates the transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes by modulating acetylation of Lys-10 (H3K9ac). Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) by JAK2 promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10464286, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11242053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11856369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12560483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15681610, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15684425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16185088, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16267050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16457588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16497732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17194708, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18066052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18243098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19783980, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20228790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20850016}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated by RAG1 in lymphoid cells, monoubiquitination is required for V(D)J recombination (By similarity).

Q4AE62	
P05771	PTM: Phosphorylation on Thr-500 within the activation loop renders it competent to autophosphorylate. Subsequent autophosphorylation of Thr-642 maintains catalytic competence, and autophosphorylation on Ser-661 appears to release the kinase into the cytosol. Autophosphorylation on other sites i.e. in the N-terminal and hinge regions have no effect on enzyme activity. Phosphorylation at Tyr-662 by SYK induces binding with GRB2 and contributes to the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling cascade (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
P20671	PTM: Deiminated on Arg-4 in granulocytes upon calcium entry. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15823041}.; PTM: Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by RING1, TRIM37 and RNF2/RING2 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression and participates in X chromosome inactivation of female mammals. It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

O43524	PTM: In the presence of survival factors such as IGF-1, phosphorylated on Thr-32 and Ser-253 by AKT1/PKB (PubMed:10102273). This phosphorylated form then interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and is retained in the cytoplasm (PubMed:10102273). Survival factor withdrawal induces dephosphorylation and promotes translocation to the nucleus where the dephosphorylated protein induces transcription of target genes and triggers apoptosis (PubMed:10102273). Although AKT1/PKB doesn't appear to phosphorylate Ser-315 directly, it may activate other kinases that trigger phosphorylation at this residue (PubMed:10102273, PubMed:11154281). Phosphorylated by STK4/MST1 on Ser-209 upon oxidative stress, which leads to dissociation from YWHAB/14-3-3-beta and nuclear translocation (PubMed:16751106). Phosphorylated by PIM1 (PubMed:18593906). Phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the activation of transcriptional activity without affecting subcellular localization (PubMed:17711846). In response to metabolic stress, phosphorylated by AMPK on Ser-30 which mediates FOXO3 mitochondrial translocation (PubMed:29445193). Phosphorylation by MAPKAPK5 promotes nuclear localization and DNA-binding, leading to induction of miR-34b and miR-34c expression, 2 post-transcriptional regulators of MYC that bind to the 3'UTR of MYC transcript and prevent its translation (PubMed:21329882). Phosphorylated by CHUK/IKKA and IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:15084260). TNF-induced inactivation of FOXO3 requires its phosphorylation at Ser-644 by IKBKB/IKKB which promotes FOXO3 retention in the cytoplasm, polyubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (PubMed:15084260). May be dephosphorylated by calcineurin A on Ser-299 which abolishes FOXO3 transcriptional activity (By similarity).

P02724	PTM: The major O-linked glycan are NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-[NeuAc-alpha-(2-6)]-GalNAcOH (about 78 %) and NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-GalNAcOH (17 %). Minor O-glycans (5 %) include NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-[NeuAc-alpha-(2-6)]-GalNAcOH NeuAc-alpha-(2-8)-NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-GalNAcOH. About 1% of all O-linked glycans carry blood group A, B and H determinants. They derive from a type-2 precursor core structure, Gal-beta-(1,3)-GlcNAc-beta-1-R, and the antigens are synthesized by addition of fucose (H antigen-specific) and then N-acetylgalactosamine (A antigen-specific) or galactose (B antigen-specific). Specifically O-linked-glycans are NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-GalNAcOH-(6-1)-GlcNAc-beta-(4-1)-[Fuc-alpha-(1-2)]-Gal-beta-(3-1)-GalNAc-alpha (about 1%, B antigen-specific) and NeuAc-alpha-(2-3)-Gal-beta-(1-3)-GalNAcOH-(6-1)-GlcNAc-beta-(4-1)-[Fuc-alpha-(1-2)]-Gal-beta (1 %, O antigen-, A antigen- and B antigen-specific). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10912628, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15313217, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3624241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:5350948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8286855}.

Q06787	PTM: Phosphorylated (PubMed:14532325). Phosphorylated on several serine residues. Phosphorylation at Ser-500 is required for phosphorylation of other nearby serine residues. Phosphorylation has no effect on the binding of individual mRNA species, but may affect the association with polyribosome. Unphosphorylated FMR1 is associated with actively translating polyribosome, whereas a fraction of phosphorylated FMR1 is associated with apparently stalled polyribosome. Dephosphorylation by an activated phosphatase may release the FMR1-mediated translational repression and allow synthesis of a locally required protein at snypases (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14532325}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated. Polyubiquitinated. Ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal degradation after activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35922}.; PTM: Monomethylated and asymmetrically dimethylated at four arginine residues of the arginine-glycine-glycine box. Methylation disrupts the binding of FMRP to RNAs through its RGG box (By similarity). Methylation is necessary for heterodimerization with FXR1, association with polyribosomes, recruitment into stress granules and translation of FMR1 target mRNAs (PubMed:16636078). Methylated by PRMT1, PRMT3 and PRMT4, in vitro (PubMed:16922515). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P35922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16636078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16922515}.; PTM: [Isoform 10]: Undergoes proteolytic cleavage; may be specifically cleaved by calpain-1/CAPN1 in cajal bodies (PubMed:24204304). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24204304}.

P02671	PTM: The alpha chain is normally not N-glycosylated (PubMed:23151259), even though glycosylation at Asn-686 was observed when a fragment of the protein was expressed in insect cells (PubMed:9689040). It is well known that heterologous expression of isolated domains can lead to adventitious protein modifications. Besides, glycosylation at Asn-686 is supported by large-scale glycoproteomics studies (PubMed:16335952 and PubMed:19159218), but the evidence is still quite tenuous. Most likely, Asn-686 is not glycosylated in the healthy human body, or only with low efficiency. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16335952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19159218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23151259, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9689040, ECO:0000305}.; PTM: O-glycosylated. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23050552}.; PTM: Forms F13A-mediated cross-links between a glutamine and the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue, forming fibronectin-fibrinogen heteropolymers.; PTM: About one-third of the alpha chains in the molecules in blood were found to be phosphorylated.; PTM: Conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is triggered by thrombin, which cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B from alpha and beta chains, and thus exposes the N-terminal polymerization sites responsible for the formation of the soft clot. The soft clot is converted into the hard clot by factor XIIIA which catalyzes the epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-linking between gamma chains (stronger) and between alpha chains (weaker) of different monomers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:2143188}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by FAM20C in the extracellular medium. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26091039}.

A6NHG4	
P17707	PTM: Is synthesized initially as an inactive proenzyme. Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed non-hydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl group blocking the N-terminus of the alpha chain. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10574985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1917972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2460457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2687270}.

O43323	PTM: The C-terminal domain displays an autoproteolysis activity and a cholesterol transferase activity. Both activities result in the cleavage of the full-length protein and covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated N-terminal fragment (N-product). This covalent modification appears to play an essential role in restricting the spatial distribution of the protein activity to the cell surface. The N-product is the active species in both local and long-range signaling, whereas the C-product has no signaling activity (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

Q15303	PTM: Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-A CYT-2 are processed by ADAM17. Proteolytic processing in response to ligand or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation results in the production of 120 kDa soluble receptor forms and intermediate membrane-anchored 80 kDa fragments (m80HER4), which are further processed by a presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase to release a cytoplasmic intracellular domain (E4ICD; E4ICD1/s80Cyt1 or E4ICD2/s80Cyt2, depending on the isoform). Membrane-anchored 80 kDa fragments of the processed isoform JM-A CYT-1 are more readily degraded by the proteasome than fragments of isoform JM-A CYT-2, suggesting a prevalence of E4ICD2 over E4ICD1. Isoform JM-B CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-2 lack the ADAM17 cleavage site and are not processed by ADAM17, precluding further processing by gamma-secretase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10744726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12807903, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15746097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16837552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17638867, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9334263}.; PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Ligands trigger phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, thereby creating binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Constitutively phosphorylated at a basal level when overexpressed in heterologous systems; ligand binding leads to increased phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1035 is important for interaction with STAT1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1056 is important for interaction with PIK3R1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1242 is important for interaction with SHC1. Phosphorylation at Tyr-1188 may also contribute to the interaction with SHC1. Isoform JM-A CYT-2 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a ligand-independent manner. E4ICD2 but not E4ICD1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251361, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17120616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17486069, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18721752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19098003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8617750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9168115}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated.

Ubiquitinated by ITCH at the cell membrane on agonist stimulation. The ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), then targets CXCR4 for lysosomal degradation. This process is dependent also on prior Ser-/Thr-phosphorylation in the C-terminal of CXCR4. Also binding of ARRB1 to STAM negatively regulates CXCR4 sorting to lysosomes though modulating ubiquitination of SFR5S. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14602072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28978524}.; PTM: Sulfation on Tyr-21 is required for efficient binding of CXCL12/SDF-1alpha and promotes its dimerization. Tyr-7 and Tyr-12 are sulfated in a sequential manner after Tyr-21 is almost fully sulfated, with the binding affinity for CXCL12/SDF-1alpha increasing with the number of sulfotyrosines present. Sulfotyrosines Tyr-7 and Tyr-12 occupy clefts on opposing CXCL12 subunits, thus bridging the CXCL12 dimer interface and promoting CXCL12 dimerization. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10089882, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12034737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16725153, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18834145}.; PTM: O- and N-glycosylated.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

Q8IXP5	
P01024	PTM: C3b is rapidly split in two positions by factor I and a cofactor to form iC3b (inactivated C3b) and C3f which is released. Then iC3b is slowly cleaved (possibly by factor I) to form C3c (beta chain + alpha' chain fragment 1 + alpha' chain fragment 2), C3dg and C3f. Other proteases produce other fragments such as C3d or C3g. C3a is further processed by carboxypeptidases to release the C-terminal arginine residue generating the acylation stimulating protein (ASP). Levels of ASP are increased in adipocytes in the postprandial period and by insulin and dietary chylomicrons.; PTM: (Microbial infection) C3 is cleaved by Staphylococcus aureus aureolysin; this cleavage renders C3a and C3b inactive. C3b is rapidly degraded by host factors CFH and CFI preventing its deposition on the bacterial surface while C3a is further inactivated by aureolysin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21502375}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by FAM20C in the extracellular medium. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26091039}.

Phosphorylation at Thr-266 enhances transactivation activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-325 in response to calcium increases transactivation activity. Phosphorylated at Thr-235 by RPS6KA1 (PubMed:11684016). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11684016}.; PTM: O-glycosylated, glycosylation at Ser-227 and Ser-228 prevents phosphorylation on Thr-235, Ser-231 and Thr-226 and DNA binding activity which delays the adipocyte differentiation program. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033}.; PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation at Lys-43 is an important and dynamic regulatory event that contributes to its ability to transactivate target genes, including those associated with adipogenesis and adipocyte function. Deacetylation by HDAC1 represses its transactivation activity. Acetylated by KAT2A and KAT2B within a cluster of lysine residues between amino acids 129-133, this acetylation is strongly induced by glucocorticoid treatment and enhances transactivation activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28033}.

Q13542	PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-37, Thr-46, Ser-65, Thr-70 and Ser-83 is mediated by MTOR and corresponds to the hyperphosphorylated form: it abolishes binding to EIF4E by inducing folding of intrinsically disordered regions (PubMed:24207126, PubMed:25533957). First phosphorylated at Thr-37 and Thr-46 by MTOR, inducing folding of region encompassing residues from Pro-18 to Arg-62 of into a four-stranded beta-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXLPhi motif into a partly buried beta-strand, blocking accessibility to EIF4E. Protein phosphorylated at Thr-37 and Thr-46 is however unstable and subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-65, Thr-70 and Ser-83 is required to stabilize the fold, decreasing affinity for EIF4E by a factor of 4000 (PubMed:24207126, PubMed:25533957). Phosphorylated in response to insulin, EGF and PDGF. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21661078, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24207126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25533957}.; PTM: Deamidated at Asn-99 and Asn-102 to aspartate (Asp) in brain. Deamidation promotes interaction with RPTOR, subsequent phosphorylation by mTORC1 and increased translation, leading to impair kinetics of excitatory synaptic transmission. Deamidation takes place during postnatal development, when the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is reduced, suggesting it acts as a compensatory mechanism to promote translation despite attenuated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling in neuron development. Deamidation converts Asn residues into a mixture of Asp and isoaspartate; interactions with PCMT1 is required to prevent isoaspartate accumulation and convert isoaspartate to Asp. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P70445}.

O00468	PTM: Contains heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains and alpha-dystroglycan as well as N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), present in the N-terminal 110 kDa fragment, are required for induction of filopodia in hippocampal neurons. The first cluster (Gly/Ser-rich) for GAG attachment contains heparan sulfate (HS) chains and the second cluster (Ser/Thr-rich), contains chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. Heparin and heparin sulfate binding in the G3 domain is independent of calcium ions. Binds heparin with a stoichiometry of 2:1. Binds sialic acid with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and binding requires calcium ions (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: At synaptic junctions, cleaved at two conserved sites, alpha and beta, by neurotrypsin. Cleavage at the alpha-site produces the agrin N-terminal 110-kDa subunit and the agrin C-terminal 110-kDa subunit. Further cleavage of agrin C-terminal 110-kDa subunit at the beta site produces the C-terminal fragments, agrin C-terminal 90 kDa fragment and agrin C-terminal 22 kDa fragment. Excessive cleavage at the beta-site releases large amounts of the agrin C-terminal 22 kDa fragment leading to destabilization at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

Phosphorylation on Ser-99 or Ser-75 promotes heterodimerization with 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction then facilitates the phosphorylation at Ser-118, a site within the BH3 motif, leading to the release of Bcl-X(L) and the promotion of cell survival. Ser-99 is the major site of AKT/PKB phosphorylation, Ser-118 the major site of protein kinase A (CAPK) phosphorylation.

O95831	PTM: Under normal conditions, a 54-residue N-terminal segment is first proteolytically removed during or just after translocation into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) to form the inner-membrane-anchored mature form (AIFmit). During apoptosis, it is further proteolytically processed at amino-acid position 101 leading to the generation of the mature form, which is confined to the mitochondrial IMS in a soluble form (AIFsol). AIFsol is released to the cytoplasm in response to specific death signals, and translocated to the nucleus, where it induces nuclear apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15775970}.; PTM: Ubiquitination by XIAP/BIRC4 does not lead to proteasomal degradation.

O-glycosylation by OGT prevents protein degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination. It also stabilizes the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer thereby increasing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcription of genes in the negative loop of the circadian clock such as PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.; PTM: Acetylated on Lys-538 upon dimerization with CLOCK. Acetylation facilitates CRY1-mediated repression. Deacetylated by SIRT1, which may result in decreased protein stability. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.; PTM: Phosphorylated upon dimerization with CLOCK. Phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity, alters the subcellular localization and decreases the stability of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer by promoting its degradation. Phosphorylation shows circadian variations in the liver with a peak between CT10 to CT14. Phosphorylation at Ser-90 by CK2 is essential for its nuclear localization, its interaction with CLOCK and controls CLOCK nuclear entry (By similarity). Dephosphorylation at Ser-78 is important for dimerization with CLOCK and transcriptional activity (PubMed:23229515). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23229515}.; PTM: Sumoylated on Lys-259 upon dimerization with CLOCK. Predominantly conjugated to poly-SUMO2/3 rather than SUMO1 and the level of these conjugates undergo rhythmic variation, peaking at CT9-CT12. Sumoylation localizes it exclusively to the PML body and promotes its ubiquitination in the PML body, ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation and the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.; PTM: Undergoes lysosome-mediated degradation in a time-dependent manner in the liver. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.

O14757	PTM: Phosphorylated by ATR in a RAD17-dependent manner in response to ultraviolet irradiation and inhibition of DNA replication. Phosphorylated by ATM in response to ionizing irradiation. ATM and ATR can both phosphorylate Ser-317 and Ser-345 and this results in enhanced kinase activity. Phosphorylation at Ser-345 induces a change in the conformation of the protein, activates the kinase activity and is a prerequisite for interaction with FBXO6 and subsequent ubiquitination at Lys-436. Phosphorylation at Ser-345 also increases binding to 14-3-3 proteins and promotes nuclear retention. Conversely, dephosphorylation at Ser-345 by PPM1D may contribute to exit from checkpoint mediated cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation at Ser-280 by AKT1/PKB, may promote mono and/or diubiquitination. Also phosphorylated at undefined residues during mitotic arrest, resulting in decreased activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10859164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11390642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12446774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12588868, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12660173, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14657349, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14681223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15650047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716789}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. Mono or diubiquitination promotes nuclear exclusion (By similarity). The activated form (phosphorylated on Ser-345) is polyubiquitinated at Lys-436 by some SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing FBXO6 promoting its degradation. Ubiquitination and degradation are required to terminate the checkpoint and ensure that activated CHEK1 does not accumulate as cells progress through S phase, when replication forks encounter transient impediments during normal DNA replication. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10859164, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11390642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12446774, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676583, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676962, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14681223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14988723, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15650047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15707391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716789}.; PTM: Proteolytically cleaved at the C-terminus by SPRTN during normal DNA replication, thereby promoting CHEK1 removal from chromatin and activating the protein kinase activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31316063}.

P05067	PTM: Proteolytically processed under normal cellular conditions. Cleavage either by alpha-secretase, beta-secretase or theta-secretase leads to generation and extracellular release of soluble APP peptides, S-APP-alpha and S-APP-beta, and the retention of corresponding membrane-anchored C-terminal fragments, C80, C83 and C99. Subsequent processing of C80 and C83 by gamma-secretase yields P3 peptides. This is the major secretory pathway and is non-amyloidogenic. Alternatively, presenilin/nicastrin-mediated gamma-secretase processing of C99 releases the amyloid-beta proteins, amyloid-beta protein 40 and amyloid-beta protein 42, major components of amyloid plaques, and the cytotoxic C-terminal fragments, gamma-CTF(50), gamma-CTF(57) and gamma-CTF(59). PSEN1 cleavage is more efficient with C83 than with C99 as substrate (in vitro) (PubMed:30630874). Many other minor amyloid-beta peptides, amyloid-beta 1-X peptides, are found in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) including the amyloid-beta X-15 peptides, produced from the cleavage by alpha-secretase and all terminating at Gln-686. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10656250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30630874}.; PTM: Proteolytically cleaved by caspases during neuronal apoptosis. Cleavage at Asp-739 by either CASP6, CASP8 or CASP9 results in the production of the neurotoxic C31 peptide and the increased production of amyloid-beta peptides. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10319819}.; PTM: N-glycosylated (PubMed:2900137). N- and O-glycosylated (PubMed:2649245). O-glycosylation on Ser and Thr residues with core 1 or possibly core 8 glycans. Partial tyrosine glycosylation (Tyr-681) is found on some minor, short amyloid-beta peptides (amyloid-beta 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19 and 1-20) but not found on amyloid-beta protein 38, amyloid-beta protein 40 nor on amyloid-beta protein 42. Modification on a tyrosine is unusual and is more prevelant in AD patients. Glycans had Neu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr, Neu5AcNeu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr and O-AcNeu5AcNeu5AcHex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O-Tyr structures, where O-Ac is O-acetylation of Neu5Ac. Neu5AcNeu5Ac is most likely Neu5Ac 2,8Neu5Ac linked. O-glycosylations in the vicinity of the cleavage sites may influence the proteolytic processing. Appicans are L-APP isoforms with O-linked chondroitin sulfate. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16335952, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21712440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22576872, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2649245, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2900137}.; PTM: Phosphorylation in the C-terminal on tyrosine, threonine and serine residues is neuron-specific (PubMed:10341243). Phosphorylation can affect APP processing, neuronal differentiation and interaction with other proteins (PubMed:10341243). Phosphorylated on Thr-743 in neuronal cells by Cdc5 kinase and Mapk10, in dividing cells by Cdc2 kinase in a cell-cycle dependent manner with maximal levels at the G2/M phase and, in vitro, by GSK-3-beta (PubMed:8131745, PubMed:11146006). The Thr-743 phosphorylated form causes a conformational change which reduces binding of Fe65 family members (PubMed:11517218). In dopaminergic (DA) neurons, phosphorylation on Thr-743 by LRKK2 promotes the production and the nuclear translocation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) which induces DA neuron apoptosis (PubMed:28720718). Phosphorylation on Tyr-757 is required for SHC binding (PubMed:11877420). Phosphorylated in the extracellular domain by casein kinases on both soluble and membrane-bound APP. This phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin (PubMed:8999878). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10341243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11146006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11517218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11877420, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28720718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8131745, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8999878}.; PTM: Extracellular binding and reduction of copper, results in a corresponding oxidation of Cys-144 and Cys-158, and the formation of a disulfide bond.

Can be O-fucosylated by POFUT2 on a serine or a threonine residue found within the consensus sequence C1-X(2)-(S/T)-C2-G of the TSP type-1 repeat domains where C1 and C2 are the first and second cysteine residue of the repeat, respectively. Fucosylated repeats can then be further glycosylated by the addition of a beta-1,3-glucose residue by the glucosyltransferase, B3GALTL. Fucosylation mediates the efficient secretion of ADAMTS family members. Also can be C-glycosylated with one or two mannose molecules on tryptophan residues within the consensus sequence W-X-X-W of the TPRs, and N-glycosylated. These other glycosylations can also facilitate secretion (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

P16860	PTM: The precursor molecule is proteolytically cleaved by the endoproteases FURIN or CORIN at Arg-102 to produce brain natriuretic peptide 32 and NT-proBNP (PubMed:21314817, PubMed:10880574, PubMed:21763278, PubMed:20489134, PubMed:21482747). This likely occurs after it has been secreted into the blood, either during circulation or in the target cells (PubMed:21482747). CORIN also cleaves the precursor molecule at additional residues including Arg-99 and possibly Lys-105 (PubMed:20489134, PubMed:21763278). In patients with heart failure, processing and degradation of natriuretic peptides B occurs but is delayed, possibly due to a decrease in enzyme level or activity of CORIN and DPP4 (PubMed:25339504). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10880574, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20489134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21314817, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21482747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21763278, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25339504}.; PTM: [Brain natriuretic peptide 32]: Undergoes further proteolytic cleavage by various proteases such as DPP4, MME and possibly FAP, to give rise to a variety of shorter peptides (PubMed:16254193, PubMed:19808300, PubMed:21314817, PubMed:21098034). Cleaved at Pro-104 by the prolyl endopeptidase FAP (seprase) activity (in vitro) (PubMed:21314817). Degraded by IDE (PubMed:21098034). During IDE degradation, the resulting products initially increase the activation of NPR1 and can also stimulate NPR2 to produce cGMP before the fragments are completely degraded and inactivated by IDE (in vitro) (PubMed:21098034). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16254193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19808300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21098034, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21314817}.; PTM: O-glycosylated on at least seven residues (PubMed:20489134, PubMed:21763278, PubMed:16750161, PubMed:17349887, PubMed:21482747). In cardiomyocytes, glycosylation at Thr-97 is essential for the stability and processing of the extracellular natriuretic peptides B (PubMed:21482747). Glycosylation, especially at Thr-97, may also be important for brain natriuretic peptide 32 stability and/or extracellular distribution (PubMed:21763278). Glycosylation at Thr-97 appears to inhibit FURIN- or CORIN-mediated proteolytic processing, at least in HEK293 cells (PubMed:20489134, PubMed:21763278). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16750161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20489134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21482747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21763278}.

P42574	PTM: Cleavage by granzyme B, caspase-6, caspase-8 and caspase-10 generates the two active subunits. Additional processing of the propeptides is likely due to the autocatalytic activity of the activated protease. Active heterodimers between the small subunit of caspase-7 protease and the large subunit of caspase-3 also occur and vice versa.; PTM: S-nitrosylated on its catalytic site cysteine in unstimulated human cell lines and denitrosylated upon activation of the Fas apoptotic pathway, associated with an increase in intracellular caspase activity. Fas therefore activates caspase-3 not only by inducing the cleavage of the caspase zymogen to its active subunits, but also by stimulating the denitrosylation of its active site thiol. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10213689}.

The predominant O-glycans are mono-sialylated forms of the disaccharide, Gal-beta-1,3GalNAc, and their sites of attachment are probably on Thr-76 and Thr-77. The GPI-anchor of soluble urinary CD59 has no inositol-associated phospholipid, but is composed of seven different GPI-anchor variants of one or more monosaccharide units. Major variants contain sialic acid, mannose and glucosamine. Sialic acid linked to an N-acetylhexosamine-galactose arm is present in two variants. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18780401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8670172}.; PTM: Glycated.

P60953	PTM: (Microbial infection) AMPylation at Tyr-32 and Thr-35 are mediated by bacterial enzymes in case of infection by H.somnus and V.parahaemolyticus, respectively. AMPylation occurs in the effector region and leads to inactivation of the GTPase activity by preventing the interaction with downstream effectors, thereby inhibiting actin assembly in infected cells. It is unclear whether some human enzyme mediates AMPylation; FICD has such ability in vitro but additional experiments remain to be done to confirm results in vivo. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19039103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19362538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20622875}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by SRC in an EGF-dependent manner, this stimulates the binding of the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14506284}.; PTM: (Microbial infection) Glycosylated at Tyr-32 by Photorhabdus asymbiotica toxin PAU_02230.

P06899	PTM: Monoubiquitination at Lys-35 (H2BK34Ub) by the MSL1/MSL2 dimer is required for histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) methylation and transcription activation at specific gene loci, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci. Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11709551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

It is also associated with post-meiotically activated genes on autosomes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21925322}.; PTM: Lactylated in macrophages by EP300/P300 by using lactoyl-CoA directly derived from endogenous or exogenous lactate, leading to stimulates gene transcription. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31645732}.
P0DPK5	PTM: Acetylation is generally linked to gene activation. Acetylation on Lys-10 (H3K9ac) impairs methylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s). Acetylation on Lys-19 (H3K18ac) and Lys-24 (H3K24ac) favors methylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Citrullination at Arg-9 (H3R8ci) and/or Arg-18 (H3R17ci) impairs methylation and represses transcription. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-18 (H3R17me2a) is linked to gene activation. Symmetric dimethylation at Arg-9 (H3R8me2s) is linked to gene repression. Asymmetric dimethylation at Arg-3 (H3R2me2a) is linked to gene repression and is mutually exclusive with H3 Lys-5 methylation (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). H3R2me2a is present at the 3' of genes regardless of their transcription state and is enriched on inactive promoters, while it is absent on active promoters. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Methylation at Lys-5 (H3K4me) facilitates subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) and Lys-28 (H3K27me), which are linked to gene repression, are underrepresented. Methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) is a specific target for HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) and prevents subsequent acetylation of H3 and H4. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Thr-7 (H3T6ph) is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of Lys-5 (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A. At centromeres, specifically phosphorylated at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) from prophase to early anaphase. Phosphorylation at Thr-12 (H3T11ph) is a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that promotes demethylation of Lys-10 (H3K9me). Phosphorylation at Tyr-42 (H3Y41ph) promotes exclusion of CBX5 (HP1 alpha) from chromatin. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P84243}.; PTM: Lysine deamination at Lys-5 (H3K4all) to form allysine.

P46531	PTM: Synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as an inactive form which is proteolytically cleaved by a furin-like convertase in the trans-Golgi network before it reaches the plasma membrane to yield an active, ligand-accessible form (By similarity). Cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment N(TM) and a N-terminal fragment N(EC). Following ligand binding, it is cleaved by ADAM17 to yield a membrane-associated intermediate fragment called notch extracellular truncation (NEXT) (PubMed:24226769). Following endocytosis, this fragment is then cleaved by one of the catalytic subunits of gamma-secretase (PSEN1 or PSEN2), to release a Notch-derived peptide containing the intracellular domain (NICD) from the membrane (PubMed:30598546). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01705, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30598546}.; PTM: Phosphorylated. {ECO:0000250}.; PTM: O-glycosylated on the EGF-like domains (PubMed:24226769). O-glucosylated at Ser-435 by KDELC1 and KDELC2 (PubMed:30127001). Contains both O-linked fucose and O-linked glucose in the EGF-like domains 11, 12 and 13, which are interacting with the residues on DLL4 (By similarity). O-linked glycosylation by GALNT11 is involved in determination of left/right symmetry: glycosylation promotes activation of NOTCH1, possibly by promoting cleavage by ADAM17, modulating the balance between motile and immotile (sensory) cilia at the left-right organiser (LRO) (PubMed:24226769). MFNG-, RFNG- and LFNG-mediated modification of O-fucose residues at specific EGF-like domains results in inhibition of its activation by JAG1 and enhancement of its activation by DLL1 via an increased binding to DLL1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q01705, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q07008, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30127001}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated. Undergoes 'Lys-29'-linked polyubiquitination by ITCH; promotes the lysosomal degradation of non-activated internalized NOTCH1 (PubMed:18628966, PubMed:23886940). Monoubiquitination at Lys-1759 is required for activation by gamma-secretase cleavage, it promotes interaction with AAK1, which stabilizes it. Deubiquitination by EIF3F is necessary for nuclear import of activated Notch (PubMed:24226769). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18628966, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23886940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24226769}.; PTM: Hydroxylated at Asn-1955 by HIF1AN.

Q14980	PTM: Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on Thr-2055 regulates the extent of cortical NUMA1 and the dynein-dynactin complex localization during mitotic metaphase and anaphase (PubMed:23921553). In metaphase, phosphorylation on Thr-2055 occurs in a kinase CDK1-dependent manner; this phosphorylation maintains low levels of cortical dynein-dynactin complex at metaphase, and hence proper spindle positioning (PubMed:7769006, PubMed:23921553, PubMed:24371089). In anaphase, dephosphorylated on Thr-2055 by phosphatase PPP2CA; this dephosphorylation stimulates its membrane association and with the dynein-dynactin complex its enrichment at the cell cortex, and hence robust spindle elongation (PubMed:23921553, PubMed:24371089). Probably also phosphorylated on Thr-2015 and Ser-2087 by CDK1; these phosphorylations may regulate its cell cortex recruitment during metaphase and anaphase (PubMed:23870127). Phosphorylated on Thr-1047, Ser-1769, Ser-1772, Ser-1789 and Ser-1834 by PLK1; these phosphorylations induce cortical dynein-dynactin complex dissociation from the NUMA1-GPSM2 complex and negatively regulates cortical dynein-dynactin complex localization (PubMed:22327364). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22327364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23870127, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23921553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24371089, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7769006}.; PTM: ADP-ribosylated by TNKS at the onset of mitosis; ADP-ribosylation is not required for its localization to spindle poles (PubMed:16076287). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16076287}.; PTM: O-glycosylated during cytokinesis at sites identical or close to phosphorylation sites, this interferes with the phosphorylation status (PubMed:20068230). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20068230}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated with 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains.

Q93079	PTM: Monoubiquitination at Lys-35 (H2BK34Ub) by the MSL1/MSL2 dimer is required for histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) methylation and transcription activation at specific gene loci, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci. Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons (PubMed:16627869). Monoubiquitinated by DTX3L upon encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-mediated infection (PubMed:26479788). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity).

Q14721	PTM: Phosphorylated. Differential C-terminal phosphorylation on a subset of serines allows graded activity-dependent regulation of channel gating in hippocampal neurons. Ser-607 and Tyr-128 are significant sites of voltage-gated regulation through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activities. Tyr-128 can be phosphorylated by Src and dephosphorylated by cytoplasmic form of the phosphatase PTPRE. CDK5-induced Ser-607 phosphorylation increases in response to acute blockade of neuronal activity. Phosphorylated on Tyr-128 by Src and on Ser-805 by MAPK14/P38MAPK; phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient for an increase in plasma membrane insertion, apoptotic potassium current surge and completion of the neuronal cell death program. Phosphorylated on Ser-520, Ser-607, Ser-656 and Ser-805 by CDK5; phosphorylation is necessary for KCNB1 channel clustering formation. The Ser-607 phosphorylation state differs between KCNB1-containing clusters on the proximal and distal portions of the axon initial segment (AIS). Highly phosphorylated on serine residues in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail in resting neurons. Phosphorylated in pancreatic beta cells in response to incretin hormones stimulation in a PKA- and RPS6KA5/MSK1-dependent signaling pathway, promoting beta cell survival. Phosphorylation on Ser-567 is reduced during postnatal development with low levels at P2 and P5; levels then increase to reach adult levels by P14. Phosphorylation on Ser-457, Ser-541, Ser-567, Ser-607, Ser-656 and Ser-720 as well as the N-terminal Ser-15 are sensitive to calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation contributing to the modulation of the voltage-dependent gating properties. Dephosphorylation by phosphatase PTPRE confers neuroprotection by its inhibitory influence on the neuronal apoptotic potassium current surge in a Zn(2+)-dependent manner. Dephosphorylated at Ser-607 by protein phosphatase PPP1CA. Hypoxia-, seizure- or glutamate-induced neuronal activity promote calcium/calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation resulting in a loss of KCNB1-containing clustering and enhanced channel activity. In response to brain ischemia, Ser-567 and Ser-607 are strongly dephosphorylated while Ser-457 and Ser-720 are less dephosphorylated. In response to brain seizures, phosphorylation levels on Ser-567 and Ser-607 are greatly reduced. Phosphorylated/dephosphorylated by Src or FYN tyrosine-protein kinases and tyrosine phosphatase PTPRE in primary Schwann cells and sciatic nerve tissue (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P15387, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q03717}.; PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation occurs in pancreatic beta cells in response to stimulation by incretin hormones in a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent signaling pathway, promoting beta cell survival. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P15387}.; PTM: Sumoylated on Lys-474, preferentially with SUMO1; sumoylation induces a positive shift in the voltage-dependence of activation and inhibits channel activity (PubMed:19223394). Sumoylation increases the frequency of repetitive action potential firing at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons and decreases its frequency in pancreatic beta cells (PubMed:19223394). Desumoylated by SENP1 (PubMed:19223394). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19223394}.

Accumulation of sterols in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, triggers binding of the reductase to the ER membrane protein INSIG1 or INSIG2 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:19458199, PubMed:21778231, PubMed:22143767). The INSIG1 binding leads to the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase, AMFR/gp78, RNF139 or RNF145, initiating ubiquitination of the reductase (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:19458199, PubMed:21778231). The ubiquitinated reductase is then extracted from the ER membrane and delivered to cytosolic 26S proteosomes by a mechanism probably mediated by the ATPase Valosin-containing protein VCP/p97 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:19458199, PubMed:21778231). The INSIG2-binding leads to the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase RNF139, initiating ubiquitination of the reductase (PubMed:22143767). Lys-248 is the main site of ubiquitination (PubMed:19458199).

P11362	PTM: Autophosphorylated. Binding of FGF family members together with heparan sulfate proteoglycan or heparin promotes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans between the two FGFR molecules present in the dimer and proceeds in a highly ordered manner. Initial autophosphorylation at Tyr-653 increases the kinase activity by a factor of 50 to 100. After this, Tyr-583 becomes phosphorylated, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr-463, Tyr-766, Tyr-583 and Tyr-585. In a third stage, Tyr-654 is autophosphorylated, resulting in a further tenfold increase of kinase activity. Phosphotyrosine residues provide docking sites for interacting proteins and so are crucial for FGFR1 function and its regulation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16507368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19224897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19665973, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8622701}.; PTM: Ubiquitinated.

P16104	PTM: Phosphorylated on Ser-140 (to form gamma-H2AX or H2AX139ph) in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by exogenous genotoxic agents and by stalled replication forks, and may also occur during meiotic recombination events and immunoglobulin class switching in lymphocytes. Phosphorylation can extend up to several thousand nucleosomes from the actual site of the DSB and may mark the surrounding chromatin for recruitment of proteins required for DNA damage signaling and repair. Widespread phosphorylation may also serve to amplify the damage signal or aid repair of persistent lesions. Phosphorylation of Ser-140 (H2AX139ph) in response to ionizing radiation is mediated by both ATM and PRKDC while defects in DNA replication induce Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) subsequent to activation of ATR and PRKDC. Dephosphorylation of Ser-140 by PP2A is required for DNA DSB repair. In meiosis, Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may occur at synaptonemal complexes during leptotene as an ATM-dependent response to the formation of programmed DSBs by SPO11. Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may subsequently occurs at unsynapsed regions of both autosomes and the XY bivalent during zygotene, downstream of ATR and BRCA1 activation. Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may also be required for transcriptional repression of unsynapsed chromatin and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), whereby the X and Y chromosomes condense in pachytene to form the heterochromatic XY-body. During immunoglobulin class switch recombination in lymphocytes, Ser-140 phosphorylation (H2AX139ph) may occur at sites of DNA-recombination subsequent to activation of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase AICDA. Phosphorylation at Tyr-143 (H2AXY142ph) by BAZ1B/WSTF determines the relative recruitment of either DNA repair or pro-apoptotic factors. Phosphorylation at Tyr-143 (H2AXY142ph) favors the recruitment of APBB1/FE65 and pro-apoptosis factors such as MAPK8/JNK1, triggering apoptosis. In contrast, dephosphorylation of Tyr-143 by EYA proteins (EYA1, EYA2, EYA3 or EYA4) favors the recruitment of MDC1-containing DNA repair complexes to the tail of phosphorylated Ser-140 (H2AX139ph). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10477747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10734083, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10959836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11673449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12419185, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12607005, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12660252, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12697768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14627815, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15059890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15489221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613478, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19092802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19234442, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22154951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9488723}.; PTM: Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AXK119ub) by RING1 and RNF2/RING2 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression (By similarity).

Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro.

It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

P08069	PTM: Autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to ligand binding. Autophosphorylation occurs in trans, i.e. one subunit of the dimeric receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the other subunit. Autophosphorylation occurs in a sequential manner; Tyr-1165 is predominantly phosphorylated first, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr-1161 and Tyr-1166. While every single phosphorylation increases kinase activity, all three tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop (Tyr-1165, Tyr-1161 and Tyr-1166) have to be phosphorylated for optimal activity. Can be autophosphorylated at additional tyrosine residues (in vitro). Autophosphorylated is followed by phosphorylation of juxtamembrane tyrosines and C-terminal serines. Phosphorylation of Tyr-980 is required for IRS1- and SHC1-binding. Phosphorylation of Ser-1278 by GSK-3beta restrains kinase activity and promotes cell surface expression, it requires a priming phosphorylation at Ser-1282.

P04637	PTM: Acetylated. Acetylation of Lys-382 by CREBBP enhances transcriptional activity. Deacetylation of Lys-382 by SIRT1 impairs its ability to induce proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylation by SIRT2 impairs its ability to induce transcription activation in a AKT-dependent manner. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10656795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20228809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171}.; PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser residues mediates transcriptional activation. Phosphorylated by HIPK1 (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-9 by HIPK4 increases repression activity on BIRC5 promoter. Phosphorylated on Thr-18 by VRK1. Phosphorylated on Ser-20 by CHEK2 in response to DNA damage, which prevents ubiquitination by MDM2. Phosphorylated on Ser-20 by PLK3 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Phosphorylated on Thr-55 by TAF1, which promotes MDM2-mediated degradation. Phosphorylated on Ser-33 by CDK7 in a CAK complex in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylated on Ser-46 by HIPK2 upon UV irradiation. Phosphorylation on Ser-46 is required for acetylation by CREBBP. Phosphorylated on Ser-392 following UV but not gamma irradiation. Phosphorylated on Ser-15 upon ultraviolet irradiation; which is enhanced by interaction with BANP. Phosphorylated by NUAK1 at Ser-15 and Ser-392; was initially thought to be mediated by STK11/LKB1 but it was later shown that it is indirect and that STK11/LKB1-dependent phosphorylation is probably mediated by downstream NUAK1 (PubMed:21317932). It is unclear whether AMP directly mediates phosphorylation at Ser-15. Phosphorylated on Thr-18 by isoform 1 and isoform 2 of VRK2. Phosphorylation on Thr-18 by isoform 2 of VRK2 results in a reduction in ubiquitination by MDM2 and an increase in acetylation by EP300. Stabilized by CDK5-mediated phosphorylation in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses at Ser-15, Ser-33 and Ser-46, leading to accumulation of p53/TP53, particularly in the nucleus, thus inducing the transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes. Phosphorylated by DYRK2 at Ser-46 in response to genotoxic stress. Phosphorylated at Ser-315 and Ser-392 by CDK2 in response to DNA-damage. Phosphorylation at Ser-15 is required for interaction with DDX3X and gamma-tubulin (PubMed:28842590). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10570149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10606744, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10884347, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10951572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11239457, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11447225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11546806, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11551930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11554766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11740489, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11780126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14702041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15053879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15701641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15866171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16377624, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16704422, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1705009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17254968, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17591690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17967874, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18022393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20041275, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20124405, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21317932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2141171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22214662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28842590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9372954}.; PTM: Dephosphorylated by PP2A-PPP2R5C holoenzyme at Thr-55.

Q9UG56	PTM: Is synthesized initially as an inactive proenzyme. Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The autoendoproteolytic cleavage occurs by a canonical serine protease mechanism, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain. During this reaction, the Ser that is part of the protease active site of the proenzyme becomes the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, which constitutes an essential element of the active site of the mature decarboxylase. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03208}.

Q6X4W1	PTM: Proteolytically processed after NMDA receptor activation. Cleaved in a calcium-dependent and calpain-sensitive manner. Calpain cleavage is essential for the translocation process from dendrites to the nucleus (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
P98161	PTM: After synthesis, undergoes cleavage between Leu-3048 and Thr-3049 in the GPS domain. Cleavage at the GPS domain occurs through a cis-autoproteolytic mechanism involving an ester-intermediate via N-O acyl rearrangement. This process takes place in the early secretory pathway, depends on initial N-glycosylation, and requires the REJ domain. There is evidence that cleavage at GPS domain is incomplete. Uncleaved and cleaved products may have different functions in vivo. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12482949}.

Q13422	PTM: Phosphorylation controls cell-cycle progression from late G(1) stage to S stage. Hyperphosphorylated during G2/M phase. Dephosphorylated state during late G(1) phase. Phosphorylation on Thr-140 is required for DNA and pericentromeric location during mitosis. CK2 is the main kinase, in vitro. GSK3 and CDK may also contribute to phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine and threonine residues. Phosphorylation on these C-terminal residues reduces the DNA-binding ability. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on Ser-13 and Ser-295 regulate TDT expression during thymocyte differentiation. Dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 regulates stability and pericentromeric heterochromatin location. Phosphorylated in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-361 and Ser-364 downstream of SYK induces nuclear translocation. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22106042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23071339}.; PTM: Sumoylated.

P25963	PTM: Phosphorylated; disables inhibition of NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity. Phosphorylation at positions 32 and 36 is prerequisite to recognition by UBE2D3 leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504922}.; PTM: Sumoylated; sumoylation requires the presence of the nuclear import signal. Sumoylation blocks ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein thereby increasing the protein stability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11124955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17956732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504922}.; PTM: Monoubiquitinated at Lys-21 and/or Lys-22 by UBE2D3. Ubiquitin chain elongation is then performed by CDC34 in cooperation with the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex, building ubiquitin chains from the UBE2D3-primed NFKBIA-linked ubiquitin. The resulting polyubiquitination leads to protein degradation. Also ubiquitinated by SCF(BTRC) following stimulus-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882136, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20347421, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20504922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7479976}.; PTM: Deubiquitinated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus Nsp2 protein, which thereby interferes with NFKBIA degradation and impairs subsequent NF-kappa-B activation.

Q6FI13	PTM: Deiminated on Arg-4 in granulocytes upon calcium entry. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15823041}.; PTM: Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by RING1, TRIM37 and RNF2/RING2 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression and participates in X chromosome inactivation of female mammals. It is involved in the initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation. Ubiquitinated H2A is enriched in inactive X chromosome chromatin. Ubiquitination of H2A functions downstream of methylation of 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (H3K27me). H2AK119Ub by RNF2/RING2 can also be induced by ultraviolet and may be involved in DNA repair. Monoubiquitination of Lys-120 (H2AK119Ub) by TRIM37 may promote transformation of cells in a number of breast cancers (PubMed:25470042). Following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it is ubiquitinated through 'Lys-63' linkage of ubiquitin moieties by the E2 ligase UBE2N and the E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168, leading to the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Ubiquitination at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) in response to DNA damage is initiated by RNF168 that mediates monoubiquitination at these 2 sites, and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin are then conjugated to monoubiquitin; RNF8 is able to extend 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro. Deubiquitinated by USP51 at Lys-14 and Lys-16 (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub, respectively) after damaged DNA is repaired (PubMed:27083998).

Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB is crucial for chromosome condensation and cell-cycle progression during mitosis and meiosis. In addition phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by RPS6KA4 and RPS6KA5 is important during interphase because it enables the transcription of genes following external stimulation, like mitogens, stress, growth factors or UV irradiation and result in the activation of genes, such as c-fos and c-jun. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph), which is linked to gene activation, prevents methylation at Lys-10 (H3K9me) but facilitates acetylation of H3 and H4. Phosphorylation at Ser-11 (H3S10ph) by AURKB mediates the dissociation of HP1 proteins (CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5) from heterochromatin.

P10071	PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple sites by protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation by PKA primes further phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3. Phosphorylated by DYRK2 (in vitro). Phosphorylation is essential for its proteolytic processing.; PTM: Transcriptional repressor GLI3R, a C-terminally truncated form, is generated from the full-length GLI3 protein (GLI3FL/GLI3-190) through proteolytic processing. This process requires PKA-primed phosphorylation of GLI3, ubiquitination of GLI3 and the presence of BTRC. GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. GLI3R formation leads to its dissociation from SUFU, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus, and repress Hh target genes. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and this has two consequences. First, GLI3R production is halted. Second, free GLI3FL translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A).

Q8N257	PTM: Monoubiquitination at Lys-35 (H2BK34Ub) by the MSL1/MSL2 dimer is required for histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) methylation and transcription activation at specific gene loci, such as HOXA9 and MEIS1 loci. Similarly, monoubiquitination at Lys-121 (H2BK120Ub) by the RNF20/40 complex gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation and is also prerequisite for histone H3 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-79' methylation. It also functions cooperatively with the FACT dimer to stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. H2BK120Ub also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing: deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient cotranscriptional splicing of a large set of exons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16627869}.; PTM: Phosphorylation at Ser-37 (H2BS36ph) by AMPK in response to stress promotes transcription (By similarity). Phosphorylated on Ser-15 (H2BS14ph) by STK4/MST1 during apoptosis; which facilitates apoptotic chromatin condensation. Also phosphorylated on Ser-15 in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and in correlation with somatic hypermutation and immunoglobulin class-switch recombination. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q64475, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12757711}.; PTM: GlcNAcylation at Ser-113 promotes monoubiquitination of Lys-121. It fluctuates in response to extracellular glucose, and associates with transcribed genes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P62807}.; PTM: Crotonylation (Kcr) is specifically present in male germ cells and marks testis-specific genes in post-meiotic cells, including X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. Crotonylation marks active promoters and enhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors. It is also associated with post-meiotically activated genes on autosomes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21925322}.; PTM: Lactylated in macrophages by EP300/P300 by using lactoyl-CoA directly derived from endogenous or exogenous lactate, leading to stimulates gene transcription. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:31645732}.
